If you've found this one way or another, welcome to my repo of my TTRPG notes.
This includes notes as a player, and as a GM (for a multitude of systems).

After forking the repo (big green code button), open Obsidian and add the folder as a new vault.

## As a Player

This is my general process for making player notes:

### Step 1: Create the notes and link them to the databases

1. Copy the `90 üß© Templates > ‚úè Campaign` folder into `10 üßô Player Campaigns`, then rename it to resemble the feel and title of the campaign.
	- (Optional) Copy the emoji into the `Dashboard` file.
2. Open the `Dashboard` file and press `Ctrl + H` to open the find and replace feature.
3. Cut the template folder link from the top of the file and place it in the "Find" box.
4. Drag the one of the database files onto the page to get the file location of the dashboard, then cut out the location and place it in the "Replace" box.
	- It should look something like "Find: `90 üß© Templates/‚úè Campaign/`" -> "Replace: `10 üßô Player Campaigns/‚òÅÔ∏è Gears of Exmoor/`"
5. Press off the boxes into the dashboard, hit `Ctrl + A` to select all the text, then hit "Replace All".

**Optional:** Add the link to your dashboard into the `üìë Campaign Overview` Kanban board. I use this to keep track of which of my player campaigns are active at a time (since there are generally more campaigns that you can play).

### Step 2: Create the entries

To create a new entry, either a PC, NPC, Quest, or Session Note, simply click on the header of the subject matter you want to add and it will bring you to the database. Once there, click the `+` button to add a new entry. This will prompt you for a new name for the file and a template. Some of the types have a template to choose from (type in "Player.md" and it should appear) and it should fill out some of the required information.

**Note:** Almost all queries to get cards to display on the dashboards require a NoteIcon to be set. The provided templates auto populate that field for you. *It may require a refresh of the database to appear. Close the tab and reopen it.* 

Once you have your items in your database, you can fill out the information as required per column. Check out what I've done in mine if you need an example.
