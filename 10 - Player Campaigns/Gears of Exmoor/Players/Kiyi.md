# Background

```
Some info about the lands and such -

In Infina, the conversation of magitech is extremely topical due to the world's best magical school, the Kijutsu Academy. A plethora of talented mages graduate the school on a yearly basis, and go on to innovate the world at large, creating several new technologies and sharing them with the world. On the other hand, many argue that the innovations taking place are against the traditionalism that Infina is steeped in.

Among the landscapes where this debate takes place is Shimoto. This city is at the base of a mountain and flanked by some of the oldest trees on this side of the world. Many myths take place in the forests adjacent to it, with the rumor of a Lifestream Spring being located there. Contrasting the ancient wood is the Kijutsu Academy that crowns the mountainside. Many students reside in the town, or on the campus itself, and during the term, Shimoto is brimming with life.

Kiyi was born into the Purazuma family, a prestigious (and nearly royal) family that were renowned as great mages and wizards, gathering wealth in the process. This has mostly been foreshadowed from the advent of magitech. Due to their traditionalist lifestyle, all children are set on high pedestals and are sent to the top academy in the country: Kijutsu Academy. This fact hasn't changed even through the evolutionary teaching methods and resources provided to students.

Among her 2 other siblings (Morishita and Furuya), she is the youngest. The lax nature her parents set on her (or more accurately, the strict nature and attention on her siblings) caused an unhinged and free lifestyle without much morals. This slowly escalated through adolescence, and culminated in an abusive and destructive personality at the academy. "Snake's Tongue" was her nickname, derived for being able to lie her way through any authority that questioned her actions towards the other students.

After the death of a few students, a full scale investigation was performed by external authorities, and it was deemed that Kiyi was the culprit. Her sweet tongue with the professors and headmaster managed to grant her expulsion, but it didn't manage to get her parents to look over the fact - she was never to return, and to never use the Purazuma name again.

A few years have passed, and her exploits through various countries has left her with little to return to and little to show for it. Her magic prowess and innate talent from the academy and bloodline can only go so far, so when she got a letter addressed for "her eyes only", she knew she had to take it.

Just some Kiyi stuff to get me in the headspace to play them, did a little class rework to more align with their backstory and motivations 

Kiyi, having been framed for a crime at her previous school of magic, had finally made it to a city that doesn't remember her crimes (or know of them). After doing a job for Avina, it became clear that something was off about their actions. They were playing exactly into the frame of mind that the one who framed her pointed her out to be. The time she spent researching proper dragon egg hatching led her to realize this.

How would they clear their name using Avina's "wish" from the cities vaults? They've managed to secure a dragon egg of all things, but after what happened with Isaac, was it safe at the knockout? It was obvious that the cat was out of the bag and the location revealed. This dragon could become a key player in the role for both assisting with Avina's job, and for finding their assailant.

||As a final nail into forcing themselves to change from their old ways, they've handed in their rapier for a bow. Although their magic was impeded by this, they are adapting, and allowing for their thoughts to take hold more. Hopefully this will make them think twice, and focus on finding leads towards their false accuser.

(current suspected roster: professors/faculty at their old school, government affiliates from Infina (her old homeland), her parents (they started to hate/dislike her profile on the family), influential parents from some of the kids she used to bully)

Purazuma family:
	Father: Azai (boomer energy, always keeps up appearances)
	Mother: Kokoro (likes flowers, hosting tea parties for the other ladies, and running the household funds)
	Siblings: 
		- Morishita (oldest brother, honorable, does kendo, top of the class)
		- Furuya (middle brother, )
	Their standing: As one of the "original 6" that founded the basis of magic in the area in and around Shimoto, they have high standing within the area. However, their legacy is all that they have. Over the last few generations, the leaders/heads have done little to enforce their standing or advancements in traditional magic. Because of this, some rumours have gone around that the family has external magitech investments to keep themselves afloat.

"The original 6"
	- Endo
		- Masters of nature magic, currently run a widespread landscaping effort against the spread of a desert
		- Widely accepted as the clan with the most "heart". Members show compassion, realism. Currently the largest family
	- Parazuma
		- Esteemed spellcasters, and forerunners of the wizarding arts
		- Has become extremely small compared to their hayday, most say they have been dethroned
	- Igarashi
		- Inventors of the elemental conduits of Oz, which channel in pure lightning and other natural energies directly into the city
		- Despite their original intentions of encouraging growth, they quickly put large taxes on the product
	- Kasai
		- Experts in magical crafting and the imbuement of mundane materials.
		- The youngest ("newcomer") to the 6, but still holds massive power because of their specialization.
		- Rumours suggest a sort of "mafia" vibe from within its ranks
	- Ohara
		- Owners of the land, merchant lines, and creators of the most stable and reproducible travel magic.
		- Because of the exclusivity to the region, it brings in its fair share of traveling wizards into the region.
	- Fujisaki
		- Although a child family to the Igarashi clan, it was conceived with many foreigners of different races and values
		- Their many different viewpoints and somewhat neutral standpoint led them to become a main actor in negotiations, and therefore security
