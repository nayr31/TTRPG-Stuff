1. Who were you before you were turned? What memories do you still carry with you from that time?
2. The story of when you were turned and about how long ago was it. Who turned you? (“Embracing” is the term for this, and it is typically an intimate thing, it requires a high level of vulnerability both physically and emotionally on both parties)
3. What brought you to L.A? Do you plan on staying? And why do you keep coming back to the Hotel Leon?
4. Who is your clan? How does your kindred view them and their traditions? Are they loyal to that given clan’s faction?

1. Rickus was an underground undertaker for the England mob, completely unaware to the rest of his family. He was extremely close with the rest of his family, and connected with Velorina through music (although their tastes were different). After she left for hollywood, they would exchange cards and keep each other updated, but it didn't last. It was unexpected but the letters and all communication stopped. Rickus got worried, and left to make sure she was okay. It wasn't long before he realized that she was fine, her career blooming even. He decided to stay close, and continued his profession in this new city, but it wasn't long until he found the Masquerade, and soon turned by his partner in order to survive. He remembers only the english mob, his sister, and his time with his partner who he remains with.
2. Its been 9 years since then. Rickus and Diane were close before and their love strong enough for them to go all in on this, but it was an odd feeling. He was still new to this, could he reconnect with his sister after all this time? He wouldn't know/try until (whatever today is - today). Diane was a part of the Lasombra clan that managed their undermarket blood collection - thats how they met.
3. His sister. Yes. The business will continue to run regardless, and business is good where the people are plentiful.
4. Lasombra. Although most of them try to climb these social ladders of these parties, he is content with being "on the bottom" making sure blood flows. Hes as loyal as Diane is, and it isn't all that far, but they both have no reason to betray their nice and comfy positions.

Rock and metal never die, and now neither will Rickus.
