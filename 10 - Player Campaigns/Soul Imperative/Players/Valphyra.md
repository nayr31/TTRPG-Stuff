Sprites are no stranger to mythical creatures and strange lands, but what drove Valphyra to explore the desert to such lengths? The rumors among the sprites were that something stirring through the dunes and wastelands of Auctoritas, so it was only natural that Valphyra and her sprite pals would go to investigate. Although most sprites like to indulge in the limelight and play with mortals in silly ways, Valphyra and her band would more often than not enjoy watching the affairs of monsters both strong and old. This would mean that yes, it was a dangerous past time, but it was the greatest source for new stories and even better tales.

The rumors about Auctoritas were true, giant worms were highly active in the area (especially for this time of year). This was quite peculiar, and as such it would be the basis for "Val and Pals" next story. Digging deeper led to a greater understanding to the worm's intrinsic needs and wants, but that would never sell in an ale soaked tavern. It was the strange movements that they made around certain areas of the sands, avoiding them at all costs). 

ValPals spent so much time that they got anxious, "Nothing is happening!" "This was a waste...". Valphyra knew what had to be done, nudge the worms into these areas and see what happens.. The next thing she remembers are the burning ashes floating through the air, the dry heat from the sun continued into the night as the lights of the sands refused to fade, and the corpses of many a worm lay still.

2. Who or what do they place their faith in? Doesn’t have to be a deity

3. Is this their first adventure? Why?

4. What does freedom mean to them? Why?

5. A hypothetical:

Your character is given the choice between a few items:

1. A weapon or similar item that ensures that enemies and any those who oppose their beliefs would surely be deterred from doing so, lest they be met with it

2. A tome that will grant them the knowledge of anything they’d ever want to know (other than how to make/get the other items), including any secret that one might have

3. A shield or similar item that would ensure that their loved ones and anyone they care about are protected and safe for eternity, though your character won’t be

4. No item at all.
