Sprites are no stranger to mythical creatures and strange lands, but what drove Valphyra to explore the desert to such lengths? The rumors among the sprites were that something stirring through the dunes and wastelands of Auctoritas, so it was only natural that Valphyra and her sprite pals would go to investigate. Although most sprites like to indulge in the limelight and play with mortals in silly ways, Valphyra and her band would more often than not enjoy watching the affairs of monsters both strong and old. This would mean that yes, it was a dangerous past time, but it was the greatest source for new stories and even better tales.

The rumors about Auctoritas were true, giant worms were highly active in the area (especially for this time of year). This was quite peculiar, and as such it would be the basis for "Val and Pals" next story. Digging deeper led to a greater understanding to the worm's intrinsic needs and wants, but that would never sell in an ale soaked tavern. It was the strange movements that they made around certain areas of the sands, avoiding them at all costs). 

ValPals spent so much time that they got anxious, "Nothing is happening!" "This was a waste...". Valphyra knew what had to be done, nudge the worms into these areas and see what happens.. The next thing she remembers are the burning ashes floating through the air, the dry heat from the sun continued into the night as the lights of the sands refused to fade, and the corpses of many a worm lay still.

ValliePallies was no more. This wasn't the first time Valphyra had messed up observations, especially ones so delicate. Long story short, she returned to the scene of the crime and contemplated, pondered, and uh, prospected, or something. "Now what?" Life as a fey sprite were wishy, but going back to the First World and trying to make amends didn't sound pleasant, and a hassle. "The worms are brainless." She thought, trying to figure out how to make light of a good situation. This was the first time since creation that she was truly alone. "I need someone to talk to." For some reason, she went to the one who she pissed off before, Balazor the Phoenix.

An odd benediction, one from a Phoenix. It is fiery and hot, while warm and encompassing. Similar to the feeling of the wayward portals that connect the realms together. Balazor was surprisingly friendly at the open presence of a lone sprite, but after boasting about their ploy with the worms he didn't seem to take it that well. "Sprite's are lowly and have no empathy for mortal beings such as the worms or I". "Eh-Wha?"

The next 6 months are a silly montage of Valphyra trying to vie for the Balazor's recognition. Spite? Trying to prove someone wrong? A feeling of home? Maybe all, maybe none.

> "I am on a quest!" The door swings open to the *extremely* short stature of a small sprite. A fiery plumed hair seems to backdrop their "hand on hips" attitude towards the room of bar-goers. "Teach me of your mortal ways!" The silence is deafening.

1. Where are they from? How do they feel about their home?

The First World, although Balazor's nest would be more apt in this era. She has little concern for the old world, its all about the here and now. If it came to it though, they would defend it.

2. Who or what do they place their faith in? Doesnâ€™t have to be a deity

Themselves and Balazor.

3. Is this their first adventure? Why?

The first one with a mortal party. Many more failed attempts turned tale that were brought back to Balazor. "Doesn't count" He said. Pfft.

4. What does freedom mean to them? Why?

Everyday life. They have never experienced oppression or anything bad ever teehee. But more seriously, being able to do what they want, when they want.

5. A hypothetical:

Your character is given the choice between a few items:

No item at all. It is the people who have the answers!
