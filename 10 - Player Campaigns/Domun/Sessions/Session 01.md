Your mission, as you are sent in - a video call with your handler:

*Carlos*: 

Advance team to scout a potentially dangerous situation.
*Planet Thurberi* is a settlement on a somewhat uninhabited, classified union work, shouldnt be dangerous
Recently had issues. Local FF monitor (callsign *Doghawk*) didnt report back after looking for the missing persons.
Need more information. Get some data and return. 
No violent reports, but information is somewhat low so details are sparse.

The colony of *Thurberi* is very desert-like, and houses a small town of ~100 people
Ship drops us off, we go there

Meet *Patti Lyle*, who seems to know what happened to the other teams.
"Youre gonna help us find the missing people right?"
They work for the UPS (Union Postal Service)
They don't deliver it. When a package has no return address, they get it and determine where it needs to go.
Packages aren't on site

A couple months back, *Meyer Ebbes* went missing, our head of security 
*Kezia Orosco*, the mechanic
*Adrian Ailu*, xenobiologist
*Doghawk* didn't come back either

Valley may flood
Water is a good idea

We start looking at the prefab houses that the missing persons were living in
*Meyer Ebbes*: Trinkets from the baronies
*Kezia Orosco*: 
*Adrian Ailu*: HVAC is broken, heat is bad, loved them alien butts
*Doghawk*:

More restless/upset
Cactus forest???
There is some other mech sized object moved through, but it ended up in the quarry
Underground tunnel system??

In the caves, we find an airlock
Opened, its a standard airlock

On a space station??
People are running around
Guy runs up in security wear, we are under attack
Our mechs are here now
*Tatlin Station*, mention of a metiod
