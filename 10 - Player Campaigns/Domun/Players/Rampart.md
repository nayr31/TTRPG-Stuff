A good soldier follows orders. That was always the case, and will always be the case. The lines can get blurred when your partner goes down beside you and the shits against the wall, but otherwise, as long as you get the job done top brass don't care too much.

Ingedore "Rampart" Vance was born into the Harrison Armory family, worked for the family, and is trying to hard not to die for it as well. He was there for the wars of 5016u, and he has been there ever since. It wasn't some extravagant mission or daring heroics that brought on his high commendation count, but the many years of battlefield experience on the frontlines.

It wasn't until recently that the overwhelming pressure and questions about "why" started to churn and break him down, resulting in a per/license restriction and oversight to class-2 weaponry due to an incident with superior(s). A promised exchange with Union had Rampart join a strike team to rescue some researchers.
