1. *You are scoundrels, what do the people in your life think about it? Who are they?*
   Those that I converse with either respect me for my position, or stay silent because of our "deals". The information broker I am close with just sees it as a business opportunity, but may think of me as corrupt.

2. *Is it ever morally justifiable to commit a crime if the end goal is to achieve a greater good for society? Does the end truly justify the means?*
   Whatever needs to be done, needs to be done.

3. *Does the act of confession and repentance erase the moral weight of a crime, or are some actions irredeemable?*
   All actions are redeemable, but guilt should always follow you.

4. *Why did you decide crime was the path for you? Did you exhaust the other options, or did this just come to you easier?*
   The church itself was salvation after the fall of my house, what came after was just survival in a cruel world.
   
5. *What constitutes a just punishment for heinous crimes? If you were your own judge, jury, and executioner, what would your sentence be?*
   

6. *What do you see as the end result of your crimes? What is your goal?*
   

7. *Are you willing to hurt, kill, ruin, and undermine others to achieve your goals? Why?*
