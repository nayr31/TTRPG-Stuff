Collision course
Nerka is on board, if it escapes bad things will happen

Hours left, evacuation wont be complete

Elevator of the operatives

Captain Baruch, he choses the overtime op and everything on the agenda

Dr.Denise Erratum approaches us
We seem to work under her, her operatives
The shop heading our way is still operational
Feeding frenzy on board, unusual

The captn tries to make us destroy the ship, but we agree with the doctor to divert the ship
