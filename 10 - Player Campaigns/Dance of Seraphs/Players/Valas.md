Asharla was a village dedicated to the worship of Crane Rowa, a true Naga descendant. Due to the events that happened some years past, it wasn't long before the long lost village was involved within these "holy wars". Not by choice of course, the peoples from Asharla were peaceful and were ever thankful that the spiritual advisors to Crane led him to make the right choices to keep the village secret for as long as it did.

Life in the village was peaceful. It was a remote village with a unified vision and purpose, to adhere to the vision of Nalinivati: "a world where nagas and nagaji worked together to succeed". Nagas served as the guardians and higher personnel, while the Nagaji were citizens and works. Within these ranks were the spiritual advisors. Half-cleric, half-Nagaji-spokespersons to the Naga.

Valas was born into, and grew into his role predetermined by the Naga higher ups. Learning folklore, testing different concoctions, and learning of the ways of gods and mortals were the day to day happenstances, and Valas was content with it. It wasn't until he took on his duties to personally oversee the advisory materials that it became apparent that Crane was slowly becoming corrupted by something unknown. The Naga (and Nagaji) being strongly attached to belief made him not express his concerns, as it would only cause more problems for himself. This decision was also how he took on most of his life: careful, concise, but timid. 

A fight breaks out between the a Naga guard and a Nagaji merchant. An extremely odd occurrence, but not rare enough to warrant concern within the peoples. To the spiritual advisory troupe however, this was a sign of the end times. Nalinivati brought this as a sign that the holy wars of the end of times would hit their small village soon. Valas was ordered to take Crane to a secret area within the village for the time being, but it would be for naught as a group of crusaders catches them by surprise.

Through the ashes of the ruined village, Valas Crane rises in the image of Naga and Nagaji, two formed into one by the will of Nalinivati and Ravithra. Valas' body remained, tainted, corrupted, changed by the powers of Crane's soul. Through revelation and spite, Valas' soul path and purpose has been forged: destroy those who would prey upon the weak, especially gods.

Exert from the lore page for Nalinivati:
> Nalinivati's thirst for arcane knowledge and her own ascent into godhood eventually led her to her own act of creation: nagaji. Inspired by, and a little in spite of, Daikitsu's affection and relationship towards her kitsune, Nalinivati quickly poured her love and care into her creation of nagaji, giving them the image of her own ophidian ancestors.
