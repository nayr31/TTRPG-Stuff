[**Terminus**](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/narrando-bunberri/a/the-terminus-militaryConflict) (n.): Global conflict between multiple factions: The [[Specters]] and the [[Dawnbreakers]]. Begun as a manifestation of a paradox within the Lifestream. A very powerful Queen of the Old World had usurped her husband's power, and nearly Ascended. Upon seeing her own fate, she sought to forcefully rewrite it. The event led to a paradox that tore a rift in Divine Gate. The resulting rift caused the rise of the Specters, a group of people that aligned themselves with the invading universal forces that sought to feed off of Maxima's viamnis.
