Vlarios stands as one of the few cities to survive the long night of the Terminus. Kingdoms fell to shadow, corruption, and war. The beautiful structures and cities built to reach the stars toppled to the weight of shadows that poured from the Rift. But Vlarios endured, scarred and alive.  
  
Once a military encampment at the crossroads of vital supply routes, it became a refuge during the earliest days of the Battles of the Terminus. Over a hundred years of war, tents gave way to timber, timber to stone, and survival hardened into culture.  
  
The city serves as a monument for those who withstood the battery and reclaimed their lives from darkness. Adventurers, soldiers, mages, and militia scrambled together, reaping the rewards of holding strong in the face of endless fighting. Their white-knuckled grip on survival has at last given way to hope. Yet, not everyone's hope for the future looks the same.

### Districts

**Duskair**  
_“Coin speaks louder than steel. Until it doesn’t.”_  
This district, once a flea market called Dusk Fair, took root during the sieges of the Terminus. The endless war brought endless vendors, and many never left. Today, Duskair is the economic heart, where wealth, influence, and legacy are traded in silk shipments. Stone buildings and storefronts mask those who believe Maxima will endure and those who still vie for its resources. Guild halls, counting houses, and refined residences sit alongside open-air bazaars, where guards are visible but don't stand for the law.  
The markets of Duskair set the bar for trade within the city limits. Wealthy benefactors deal in expeditions and adventuring groups, their transactions shrouded behind silk curtains and locked doors. Here, battles and duels are won with coins and words rather than armor and steel.  
  
**Serpoint**  
_“We survive together—or not at all.”_  
Formerly Serene Waypoint, Serpoint was built to house travelers and troops fleeing the bloodshed. Few ever left, and the district sprawled upward, its buildings linked by rope bridges and rooftop walkways, its streets alive with constant motion.  
Life in Serpoint is communal by necessity. Entire blocks share kitchens, water sources, and shrines, and neighborhood militias protect their own streets more reliably than any city watch. Rumors spread quickly, carried by laborers and children alike, and what begins as a whisper in Serpoint often becomes a citywide truth within days. Disappearances are rare, but when they happen, they are quietly attributed to dangers beyond the walls, even when the truth lies closer to home.  
  
**Ragton**  
_"We already paid the price."_  
Ragton bears its name honestly. Originally known as Ragged Town, it was formed from long-term barracks and field hospitals that were never dismantled. Veterans, refugees, and mercenaries had taken root, building homes from scavenged timber, salvaged metal, and the rubble of siege engines.  
Memorials line Ragton’s streets, some carved in stone, others scratched into metal by hand. Residents still identify themselves by former units or commanders, and old loyalties forge alliances that uphold order with quiet authority. It is widely known that the Reclaimers’ Accord draws much of its strength from this district. Some in Ragton believe that the war merely changed shape, that readiness is the only reason Vlarios still stands.  
  
**Cosstore**  
_"Nothing is wasted. Everything can have a second life."_  
Cosstore began as a storage and supply district, once known as Cozy Store. Now it's the industrial backbone of Vlarios, fueled by salvage, manufacture, and unyielding ingenuity. Forges burn, and workshops hum with both mundane labor and unstable magic reclaimed from the Old World  
Accidents are common, and water contamination has occurred often enough that whether or not one is safe after drinking often becomes a game. Despite this, Cosstore provides steady work and reliable pay, making it indispensable to the city. Behind the noise and smoke, multiple companies quietly compete for control over production, stockpiles, and experimental devices; Each claiming their efforts are necessary for the city’s defense.  
  
**Crossroad Burn**  
_"The fire never truly went out."_  
Crossroad Burn marks the site of Vlarios’s greatest early devastation. When the encampment was nearly overrun during the Terminus, fire swept through this district, killing thousands and leaving scars that never fully healed. Charred foundations still surface during construction, and some streets refuse to stay repaired.  
Rebuilt out of necessity rather than care, Crossroad Burn exists on the city’s margins. Law enforcement is minimal, and residents rely on personal justice and community bonds. Radical ideas spread quickly here, and the Fallenshroud finds no shortage of recruits among those who feel forgotten or betrayed. Fires still break out without a clear cause, and many believe something beneath the ashes resents being left behind.

### Guilds and Factions

[[The Reclaimer's Concord]]
The Reclaimers’ Concord is the most visible symbol of hope in the post-Terminus world. Formed from surviving military units, faith-bound wardens, and those who once fought alongside, or in the name of, the Heroes, the Concord exists to reclaim land lost to the Terminus and ensure such devastation never returns. They are soldiers, priests, engineers, and healers bound by a shared oath: to protect the future, no matter the cost.  
Their banners fly over newly cleared settlements, their sanctified wards mark safe roads, and their patrols are often the first sign that civilization is returning to a ruined region. To many, the Concord is proof that the world can be rebuilt.  
  
[[The Fallenshroud]]
The Fallenshroud operates in shadows, both literal and ideological. While widely regarded as a thieves’ guild, they are in truth aligned with the remnants of the Specters; Those who believe the Terminus was not a catastrophe, but a necessary reckoning.  
They deal in smuggling, espionage, assassination, and the theft of powerful artifacts, often destabilizing other factions in the process. Recruitment is most visible in Crossroad Burn, where resentment and desperation run high. Many dismiss the Fallenshroud as criminals, but those who watch closely know they are patient, organized, and waiting for something to return.  
  
[[The Gilded Exchange]]
The Gilded Exchange presents itself as the stabilizing force of Vlarios. As a merchant consortium, it controls trade routes, expedition funding, and price regulation, ensuring the city remains supplied as the world slowly reopens.  
Behind closed doors, the Exchange manipulates scarcity, influences city officials, and quietly decides which reclamation efforts succeed or fail. While they claim neutrality, few doubt that the Exchange benefits from prolonged instability. Just so long as it remains profitable.  
  
[[The Hearthbound Circles]]
The Hearthbound Circles are not a formal faction, but they wield power all the same. Emerging from neighborhood councils, mutual aid networks, and local militias (particularly in Serpoint) they coordinate food distribution, housing, and street-level defense.  
Individually, the Circles are small. Collectively, they represent the will of the people of Vlarios. Their strength lies in unity, and many fear that a single charismatic voice could rally them into a force capable of reshaping the city’s future. For better or worse.

### History

Before the [[fall of the Old World]], the land where Vlarios now stands was a strategic crossroads between valleys, forests, and rivers, valuable in war but forgotten in peace. The Battles of the Terminus changed that. Shadows poured forth from the Rift, and the land collapsed under extra-dimensional forces. This crossroads became a rallying point. Wounded soldiers gathered here. Refugees followed. Supply caravans arrived and never left. What was meant to be temporary became essential.  
  
For a century, Vlarios endured a state of siege, surviving through constant movement and ceaseless adaptation. While other strongholds fractured under infighting or were consumed by the Specters, Vlarios persisted through necessity rather than unity. Neighborhoods defended themselves, and veteran groups enforced their own laws. Trade, not ideology, kept the city fed. The five districts of Vlarios began to take shape, growing outward from the original encampment.  
  
Ninety years into the Terminus, a small group of Heroes emerged, figures now spoken of with reverence and uncertainty. Dedicated and utterly devoted to ending the years of darkness, they set out into the areas where the Shadows reached the deepest, seeking lost artifacts and any link to the Gods. For ten years, they searched. Their final journey brought them to Vlarios, where they fought to recover the Wand of Wishes, one of the last artifacts capable of influencing Maxima itself. With three Vestiges in hand, the Heroes sealed the Rift and ended the endless war. The Shadows did not disappear, but the torrent finally ceased.  
Vlarios survived once more.  
  
Thirty years have passed since the sealing of the Rift. The land beyond the city walls is still treacherous. Monsters linger. Corrupted places resist reclamation. Yet for the first time in generations, the world is no longer ending. Vlarios has transformed from a wartime necessity into a center of rebuilding. Reclamation efforts launch from its gates, and magic academies and martial orders recruit openly. Trade routes cautiously reestablish themselves, hoping to entice a sense of normalcy to the wartorn city.  
But peace has brought its own dangers.  
  
Without a unified authority from the Old World, power in Vlarios is up for grabs. Merchant guilds, renegade veterans, new neighborhoods, and ideological groups vie for "the good of the city.” Some truly do, while others see chaos as an opportunity.
