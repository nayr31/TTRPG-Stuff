Welcome to Vlarios
Shadows creep from every inch of Xiogale. Dark forces aim to snuff the planet and plunge this part of the universe into darkness. The worst of it is over, thanks to.... Who was it that saved the world? No matter. While stable, Xiogale still has many areas in which the Shadows refuse to let go. These areas are by and large much of the landscape. However desolate the world seems now, it's only getting darker.

The one place where the world's fate doesn't seem so dismal is Ekatra. This country lies in the ruins of a once great kingdom. Used as an encampment during the final battles of Terminus (the events leading up to the end of the world), many have flocked to this area in search of a new start and for one commodity that seems rare these days; Hope.

Adventurers, soldiers, magic students, and anyone left alive who can take a stand convene in Vlarios to battle back the darkness that lingers. Each battle, each town reclaimed, each monster slain gives the world back their land. Their home. And yet, even here, reclaiming the land for the living, the power vacuum is a temptation that attracts not just feral creatures, but truer monsters. Power hungry factions bloom to take advantage of crumbling institutions left 30 years ago by the Terminus. 

And you, with the strangest pull in your chest, find yourselves drawn to help.
