# Background

Slyborne

Ekarta became the last bastion of hope against the darkness. But with every source of power and hope there will always be those who wish to take that power for their own. Nelo and his younger sister, **Klem**, were no strangers to these power struggles.

Born in a neighboring continent, Klem and Nelo fled from their homeland long before it was taken in an effort to escape their generation spanning blood-contract. They were born into servitude of a clan of assassins and other bounty hunters, Klem and Nelo's bloodline were used as "Sin-Eaters". Their role in which they would absorb the karma and other spiritual side effects that the clan accumulated, physically manifesting the "rot". This wasn't an easy task, physically or mentally, and although they were valuable assets to the clan, they were treated as slaves. It was only after the 10th year after the ritual of belayed atonement that Klem started to show physical signs of the negative karma, an extremely early case (and a death sentence). 

Using his skills he observed from the clan members (and their arrogance), Nelo escaped with Klem over the border to Ekarta. Red in tooth and claw, they both fought desperately to relieve themselves of their generation spanning pact, but their success only led to failure as it was too late to save Klem from her afflictions. Nelo used his adopted skills to make money and connections in an attempt to find a cure, but all it left him with were unwanted debts and a sour taste in his mouth.

Klem's funeral was a small one, but Nelo made sure to make her passing one full of love, just as she showed him a smile and cheered him up in their darkest times at the clan. Her memory in tow, Nelo needs to move fast as the clan has caught up, and being undercover isn't easy (or cheap).

*The effects of the lingering belayed atonement ritual are unknown to Nelo, but he is aware just how dangerous they can be*. 

# Personality and style

Acting like a cold-blooded mercenary to survive, he can't stand not being the "good guy" so he doesn't have to see others suffer like Klem did.

> [!caution]- Gemini suggestions
> Since Nelo spent years observing assassins but was never "officially" trained, his style is likely pragmatic, messy, and efficient.
>
>- **The "Cleanliness" Obsession:** Because he spent his life watching Klem "rot" from spiritual filth, Nelo is pathologically clean. He washes his hands until they are raw and cannot stand the sight of mud or grime on his gear. To him, dirt feels like the physical manifestation of the karma that killed his sister.
  >  
>- **Aversion to Physical Touch:** Having seen how the Sin-Eating ritual transferred via proximity and touch, Nelo is extremely "touch-starved" but also terrified of it. He flinches if someone claps him on the shoulder, fearing he might accidentally pass a debt—or catch one.
  >  
>- **Conversational Ghosting:** He still talks to Klem. Not necessarily out loud where people can hear, but he leaves a space for her at tables or tilts his head as if listening to her "cheering him up" when things get grim. It’s his way of keeping her smile alive, but it makes him look slightly unhinged to outsiders.
  >  
>- **The Debt-Hater:** He refuses to accept "favors." Because of his history with the blood-contract, he views any unpaid debt as a literal death sentence. He will overpay for bread just so he doesn't owe the baker a copper.
>
> To understand why Nelo is so driven, we have to see how Klem acted while she was alive.
>
>- **The Collector of "Small Joys":** Knowing her time was short, Klem had a quirk of collecting mundane, beautiful things—vibrant autumn leaves, smooth river stones, or colorful pieces of glass. Nelo likely still carries a small pouch of these "useless" items; they are his most prized possessions.
  >  
>- **Humor as a Shield:** Klem likely developed a wicked, gallows-humor sense of wit. When the "rot" would flare up, she’d make a joke about how she was "finally getting that tattoo she wanted." This is why Nelo has a "sour taste" in his mouth now; the world is silent without her commentary.
>
> Nelo seems like the type of character who tries to act like a cold-blooded mercenary to survive in Ekarta, but his "Sin-Eater" nature keeps forcing him to be the "good guy" because he can't stand to see others suffer the way Klem did.
## Physical/First Layer (outer)

Nelo's past had a heavy influence on his fighting style and core values. Because of his lack of training, his kills are often messy (but efficient).

The rot that spread throughout Klem's body has left him with an aversion to touch, and anything that might stain himself. Pathologically clean, dirt and other extremities that might taint his natural fur color reminds him of both Klem's past, and his possible future.

He still holds onto Klem in any way he can. This can come from ordering extra food, keeping a spot for her, or tilting his head as to listen to her inspiring words.

Favors are debts that are meant to tie you down, something Nelo won't ever let him be again.

## Influences

They always knew Klem's time was short. This led both of them (mostly Klem) to collect small trinkets and things she found cute or significant. Now he carries them around, forever a memory of those short days they were both free.

Due to her nature, even those last few days together Klem was making jokes (bad, dark humor) to try and make light of the situation for Nelo. "The world was silent without her commentary" (yes I stole that line)
