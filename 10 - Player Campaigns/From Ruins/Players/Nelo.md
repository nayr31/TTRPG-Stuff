Ekarta became the last bastion of hope against the darkness. But with every source of power and hope there will always be those who wish to take that power for their own. Nelo and his younger sister, Klem, were no strangers to these power struggles.

Born in a neighboring continent, Klem and Nelo fled from their homeland long before it was taken in an effort to escape their generation spanning blood-contract. They were born into servitude of a clan of assassins and other bounty hunters, Klem and Nelo's bloodline were used as "Sin-Eaters". Their role in which they would absorb the karma and other spiritual side effects that the clan accumulated, physically manifesting the "rot". This wasn't an easy task, physically or mentally, and although they were valuable assets to the clan, they were treated as slaves. It was only after the 10th year after the ritual of belayed atonement that Klem started to show physical signs of the negative karma, an extremely early case (and a death sentence). 

Using his skills he observed from the clan members (and their arrogance), Nelo escaped with Klem over the border to Ekarta. Red in tooth and claw, they both fought desperately to relieve themselves of their generation spanning pact, but their success only led to failure as it was too late to save Klem from her afflictions. Nelo used his adopted skills to make money and connections in an attempt to find a cure, but all it left him with were unwanted debts and a sour taste in his mouth.

Klem's funeral was a small one, but Nelo made sure to make her passing one full of love, just as she showed him a smile and cheered him up in their darkest times at the clan. Her memory in tow, Nelo needs to move fast as the clan has caught up, and being undercover isn't easy (or cheap).

*The effects of the lingering belayed atonement ritual are unknown to Nelo, but he is aware just how dangerous they can be*.
