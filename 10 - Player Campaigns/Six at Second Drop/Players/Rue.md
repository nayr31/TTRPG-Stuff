Its been nearly 5 cycles since Rue has left Nex, the original birthplace of all Ghorans and they are no closer to finding out a way to help their species. Through these travels however it has been very clear just how the outside world sees the Ghorans and their usefulness to them -- its a harsh world out there, and not that many people can be trusted. I miss the grove, but there is comfort in the natural embrace of nature and its many critters. A great deterrent is the red ant, and many a defender the elusive spider. Warm companions on a long journey.

There is one final place that seems promising, the Second Drop Conservatory. The vast knowledge there may have what we need to save our race. It has been a long time coming, and it must come. After seeing so many enclaves along their trip, they could only imagine the worst -- a single seed left. This had to be it, right? They will spend the rest of their cycle here before moving on, there isn't much time left.

Entering the Second Drop Conservatory comes with a caveat: Ghorans are in danger due to their fragile constitutions during their regeneration cycle. As such [[Zaxi]] has been assigned to make sure they are safe from within the walls of the academy. A Ghoran student is rare, so having an attendant of sorts is of great importance (especially from a PR standpoint). In turn, the school has also asked that they keep an eye on [[Zaxi]], although they are unsure as to why...
