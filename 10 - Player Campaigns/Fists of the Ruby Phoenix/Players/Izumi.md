- The Nobushi's description matches that of the [Onna-bugeisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onna-bugeisha) (女武芸者; lit. "female martial warriors"), female warriors, typically of nobility, who were part of the bushi (samurai) class, partaking in battles along samurai men in times of need. They were trained in the use of weapons so that they can protect their household, family and honour during times of war.
	- While the onna-bugeisha used the same weapons as their male counterpart, the naginata was the most popular weapon-of-choice for them. Being used by many famous onna-bugeisha, the naginata has been the iconic image of female warriors in Japanese pop culture.
	- "Nobushi" (野武士) roughly translates into English as "Outsider Warrior" or "Civilian Warrior." The word "野" was also used in reference to areas outside the main castle and city.
