**Charlie Reference:**
**Greatest Fear:** being alone/losing people (and cacti)
**Important NPC:** Avra/Chuck (his parents)
**Relevant Arc (optional):** something is **off** with him about Ellie. he made this friend just for them to leave? he probably has abandonment issues and doesnt know it. still glad to be back though (yea i realise this isn't an arc, just want something down for the future in case i think of something)
**Backstory:**

Charlie was born to Avra and Chuck Way. Once born, Avra, once a music teacher, decided to homeschool Charlie. That way she has more time to do what she loves: composing music (and spending time with her kid). Chucks business "skatewayz", a skate shop, was doing well, so they were never under pressure for money. He grew up surrounded by his interests (what his parents had him do - music and boarding), but never any friends. 

Getting into highschool, he knew he needed something to relate to the other kids about. The only thing he could think of was food and fashion. He was diligent, learned the "trends", and found good places. He was able to vibe well enough with people, but none of the circles he was in really "clicked", and never made a true "friend" that he could hang out with after school.

"Maybe an after school activity? Something light, like TTRPGs" he thought to himself, having no idea how heavy TTRPGs can be. This new club is around too!

He wasn't *alone alone*, there was always the nearby skate park with the older kids. But days go on and people come and go.

Relationship Map

**Baccus**
It was an unlikely meeting, but a meeting that would send them through first experiences, harsh arguments, and sweet memories. Dating is just like you might think in high school, but after the group disbanded, so did they. It wasn't until recently that the group (mostly through Rhea) started getting along again, but unbeknownst to the others Charlie and Bacchus had already started seeing each other again. 

**Connor**
Living so close to one another means that even in your first years of school will you be close, but too far and you will never meet, just right and you are school bus friends. And it was just that- Different classes, different friends, different views, but they always found a way to entertain each other on those oddly packed busses.

**Claire**
(Taken from Fauna)
You ever think taking a high potency edible and walking around town is a good idea? It’s not, but Claire still did it. Charlie found her staring in his parents storefront for about 15 minutes straight before asking if she was ok, she was not. He helped her chill out a little before helping her get home, and the two stayed friends, with Claire stopping by his family’s shop during her breaks from work or after school.
