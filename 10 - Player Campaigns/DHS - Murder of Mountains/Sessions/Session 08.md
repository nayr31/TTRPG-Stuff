Summary: Recording of Hank, and the last known remnant of Marmec...
---
Hanks face on the big screen on the elevator screen, its a recording.

"10 years now..."
Don't trust Marmec
Get out, leave, don't linger

Marmec attacks use, trying to find out what makes us special
An attempt to mend...

Not in the shaft, we are out
See trees - native, mountains,
Fog opens and we see the gaze of something horrid
Mount Verde

Marmec is there
The mountain stares down at him
He disappears into the fog, closing the hole that allowed us to see the top of the mountain

Reeves is there, we leave
Back to the retreat
