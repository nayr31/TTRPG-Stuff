Brace into the building

Montana and Orville can be heard inside, we get them out

The recon vehicle is doing recon finding for a way off the island

Cassian got the drill working, but there are problems. It wans't supposed to be used that deep.
Montana and Orville couldnt figure out how to get off, some of the mechs had some amphibious adaptations.

We made convictions to stop Cassian and the drill.
The north side, lava everywhere. Drilling and billing, combat starts.

We stop the drill, call up Orville, and jump into a hole. The wrong hole lmao
