we all know each other, more/less depending on join date

distress signal coming from an abandoned research station

"Wings of Pas Hemet"
Seraphim is the ship
ASH Rose (cogant mind? ship - AI not NHP)
known Juno's character, [[Lotus]] for a bit
(grew up there, knowing ash rose)

everyone is waiting around, on their way towards the distress beacon with their wing
(introductions)

cogent mind is displayed proudly on the command bridge
represented by a voice line thing in a holographic thing
"Enjoying yourself?"
"Worrying readings"
"Radiation...Radio disturbance"

we pass through the point of no return, a "membrane"

a ring, similar to the lighthouse, broken in one space
possibly received a few days ago

dead bodies float, dead, dead, in space, can't be alive
map obtained from ping, no response (comms blackout probably)
terminal nearby

```
[SOS SIGNAL...ONGOING] [PAST SECURITY LOGS...ACCESSIBLE] [INITIATE SCUTTLING SEQUENCE...OPERATIONAL]
```

security footage: reactor is going on an overloading sequence
scientists seem calm, higher one is gawking at it
transcribed:
"is the experiment operational"
"yes"
"reality transference event, stage 4"
// end recording, no more

[[Lotus]] attempts to gain more information from the power spire

```
[COMMAND LOGS...ACCESSIBLE] [MISSION STATEMENT...ACCESSIBLE] [INITIATE DIMENSIONAL CROSSING...#_!)$(*XA!@]
```

seems they were trying to harness paracausal sequence
subject "42"

the missiong statement of this station is to develeop new mental pathways to the existance of para causal energy signatures, direct transportation endevours

spire rumbles, migrane flashes
voice eminates from the terminal
"do not be quick to abandon that you don't understand"
"scientists trapped me"
"name common is RA" ðŸ‘€
how tf did RA get trapped by a normie scientist

interdimensional space entity has emerged in another reality
one like RA, not too dissimilar

RA says some words, we pass out
