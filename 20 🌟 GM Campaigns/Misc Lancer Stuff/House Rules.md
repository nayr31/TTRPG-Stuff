## Actions

Some types of actions have been changed.
### Reactions

Reactions are special actions that can be made outside of the usual turn order as responses to incoming attacks, enemy movement, and other events. Each reaction can only be used a certain number of times per round, and a character can take only one reaction per turn (their turn or that of another character), but there is no limit to how many reactions can be taken, overall. Mechs have two default reactions, each of which can be taken once per round – BRACE and OVERWATCH – but some systems and talents grant additional reactions. Unless specified, reactions resolve after the action that triggers them. Some resolve beforehand under specific triggers, such as when an attack is declared but before the roll is made – if so, the reaction will specify.

==Normally, Reactions recharge at the beginning of the character's turn on the next round. ALL Reactions recharge at the beginning of the next round.==

## 
## Conditions

Below is a non-comprehensive list of conditions that have been changed. 
### Stunned

STUNNED mechs cannot OVERCHARGE, move, or take any actions – including free actions and reactions, ==however, they may take 1 Quick Action==. Pilots can still MOUNT, DISMOUNT, or EJECT from STUNNED mechs, and can take actions normally. STUNNED mechs have a maximum of 5 EVASION, and automatically fail all HULL and AGILITY checks and saves.
