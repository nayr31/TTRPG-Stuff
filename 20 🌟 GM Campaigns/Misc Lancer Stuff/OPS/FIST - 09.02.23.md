LL10, a bunch of homebrew

**Brief:**
> Harrison Armory has gone too far. Their latest extensions into a suspected SSC false-Gaia world go beyond their authorities, even if Omninet chatter pings extremely suspicious shipping routes. You are FIST, a special ops unit under Union direction, and currently on a direct impact course with MAYFARE-VII, the SSC false-Gaia world.

> Your ship, or what's left of it, was hit by an orbital cannon situated on the planet. This poses a few ideas of though:
> 1. Why would SSC build an orbital defence system for a seemingly unhospitable world?
> 2. Why would they shoot you, members of Union?

> While the first answer might not come as easy, being FIST, you can't have any identifying markers that ties you to one person or organization.
