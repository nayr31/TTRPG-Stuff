LL10, a bunch of homebrew

# Words and words

## Brief:

> Harrison Armory has gone too far. Their latest extensions into a suspected SSC false-Gaia world go beyond their authorities, even if Omninet chatter pings extremely suspicious shipping routes. You are FIST, a special ops unit under Union direction, and currently on a direct impact course with MAYFARE-VII, the SSC false-Gaia world.

> Your ship, or what's left of it, was hit by an orbital cannon situated on the planet. This poses a few ideas of thought, but there isn't enough time for that. Brace for impact.

## Scene: 0.1 - Crash

> Escape pods are for losers, luckily you could repurpose a heat shield to field your re-entry.

> With a smokey haze in the air, you land "safely". Large warnings on your mech's internal screens indicate that the air is severely toxic, rebreathers required. You wonder how trees can sustain, but that's not your job. First order of business: locate the HA incursion force. The nearby comms complex seems like a suitable place to start.
