[[Thennis Spar Checkpoints & Problems]]


# Featured Locations
- **Arborist Temple.** Like everything in Thennis Spar, this sacred site is both impossibly ancient and unbelievabl futuristic. Word is that the Arborists are hoarding some serious tech in their inner sanctum (not to mention all the secrets of the multiverse).
- **The Forum.** You can find just about anything here if you know where to look, including strange delicacies, impossible wonders, and all the components and gear a crew could ask for. The question is: what do you have to trade?
- **The Catacombs.** In a city full of ancient architecture, the catacombs pre-date almost everything else by centuries. Secrets hide inside these winding tunnels, but who knows what else is waiting for you in the darkness. Finding your way in is difficult, finding your way out is even worse.
