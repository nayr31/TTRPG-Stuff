This volleyball-sized hover drone observes all its surroundings at once with hundreds of mechanical irises. Why does it watch you? Who does it serve? Will you catch it before it flies away? Probably not but you also donâ€™t want to just be standing here when the backup arrives. Time to jet, buster.

- Patrols silently, stalks you from a distance.
- Catches you in the act, records everything.
- Flees trying to get in signal range.
- Nearly impossible to hit, but its avoidance chip overheats if strained too long.
- Intentionally winds and weaves through dangerous areas, mocking you with sassy bleeps.
- When in range, requests backup and attempts to upload the evidence.
- Begins self-destruct sequence.
