Like their smaller, cuter, exponentially-less-deadly relative the hermit crab, this species of metadecapod relies on an exogenous shelter system to protect its soft, terrifying body. In the absence of giant metaterrestrial mollusk shells, the salvage crab settles for small buildings and vehicles—in this case an F-14 fighter jet.

- Hits the afterburners and gives chase.
- Joined by its hotshot wingcrab to hunt in tandem
- Launches sidewinder missiles, destroying terrain, trying to get a lock (targeted, nearly blown up, etc.)
- Brings down the big claw (grappled, crushed, etc.)
- Ejects before its shell explodes, exposing a hooked tail—soft and vulnerable but dripping with toxic secretions (bad rash, literally can’t stop puking, etc.)
- Scoops you into a mouth full of sharp, feathered maxillipeds (horrified, chewed, etc.)
