Easily confused with psychic alligators, these hungry, hungry reptiles infest murky waters throughout the local multiverse, feeding on the data-rich nerve clusters of intelligent prey and the whatever-rich whatevers of anything else they find.

- Bursts from the water.
- Chases you with an honestly startling landspeed or by weaving through the air as it swims up through your psychic wake.
- Hacks your nervous system (paralyzed, slowed, controlled like a meat puppet, etc.)
- Bites you (multiple punctures, grappled, dislocated shoulder, etc.) and tries to pull you under the water.
- Feasts on your good memories (confused, sad, etc.)
- Repulsed by bad-tasting memories
