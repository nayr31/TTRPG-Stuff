BloodWhip Swarm Despite their cutesy name, abyssal bloodwhips are actually pretty gross. Theyâ€™re like flying tapeworms. They have a series of combination heart-stomachs, mate for life, and can scream, usually when frightened or about to fly in for a tasty marrow-bore. Bloodwhips subsist primarily on marrow.

- Hard to hit with pinpoint damage, but vulnerable to masers, explosions, fire, and other area effects.
- Envelops you in a blinding cloud of monster.
- Clogs gear up with what looks like silly string but is actually just metres and metres of bloodwhip.
- Screams in a startling chain reaction ending with you (freaking out, deafened, etc.)
- Works its way into your hazwear and under your clothes looking for a nice bony drill site.
- Drinks your marrow! (fatigue, bone-holes, etc.)
