From the Latin, meaning how much one hundred foot, the quantum centipede is a question with no safe answer. A fractal, trypophobic mushroom trip of sharp chitinous legs. A non-integer of spiracled body segments multiplying as you try to find the end of it. A horror with no terminus, arcing toward you on a sine wave of hooked claws. A total bummer.

- Weak to attacks on its rarely-seen rearmost body segment.
- Breaks your tiny little brain on sight (freaking out , hyper-reflection, etc.)
- Blocks your escape with chittering coils of itself.
- Grabs you with sharp forcipules (grappled, cut, etc.)
- Injects you with venom (woozy, paralyzed, etc.)
- Swallows you whole and slowly digests your future, starting with the best possible outcomes
