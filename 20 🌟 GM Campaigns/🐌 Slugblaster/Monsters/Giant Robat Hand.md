Battalions of rusting warbots lie scattered across worlds, relics of long-forgotten interdimensional conflict. Most are dead, useful only as salvage. But some of these machines (or pieces of them) remain active, wandering the multiverse like autonomous roninâ€”broken soldiers without a war, their purpose lost in a tangle of buggy, half-eroded protocols.

- Stalks around like a tarantula, scanning random stuff.
- Can be hacked via a hard-to-reach panel.
- Pursues with jet boosters, curling into a collision fist.
- Fires a salvo of microrockets (battered, burned, etc.)
- Deflects attacks with unexpected forcefield.
- Grows hardlight claws and strikes (stabbed, etc.)
- Pulls you right into its palm with a tractor beam.
- Squeezes you like a lime or attempts to flee with a hostage as part of its baffling 8-bit agenda.
