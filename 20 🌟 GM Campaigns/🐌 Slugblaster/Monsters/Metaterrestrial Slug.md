The multiverse has a slug problem. Although most life-bearing worlds have their own native varieties, most of the slugs you encounter are likely to have come from a single, highly-adaptive transdimensional species even more invasive and destructive than the teenagers running away from them!

- Chases you quickly on a negafriction slime trail.
- Pummels you with a jet of mucus from a real gross nozzle thing (slimed, stuck, slowed, etc.)
- Why does it keep regenerating!?
- Absorbs power with its EM-siphon (flickering gear, dead battery, etc.) and grows way bigger/faster.
- Harpoons you with its barbed radula (grappled, scraped up, etc.)
- Retracts you slowly into its esophagus through a wet tunnel of sharp denticles.
