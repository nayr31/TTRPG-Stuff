When the course of reality is altered, an infinite number of possible futures collapse into one, and sometimes, their raw potentiality concentrates to form a Variance Wraith. Its incorporeal form is out of phase with the fabric 
of space and time, and its only goal is the destruction of reality itself.

● Cannot be reasoned with or hidden from.
● Pursues you like a freight train of smoke and tar.
● Kills plants, boils water, and melts terrain with its ghostly shrieks (terrified, reality-scrambled, etc.)
● Uh oh, your attacks go right through it.
● Grows bigger as it devours life and energy.
● Splits into two (sorry).
● Slices with spectral claws (cut, quantum injury, etc.)
● Digs its way in and takes over your body, shunting your mind off into some kind of nethersphere.
