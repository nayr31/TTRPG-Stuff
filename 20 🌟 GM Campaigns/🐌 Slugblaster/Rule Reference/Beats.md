Sure, Slugblaster is mostly about hoverboarding away from monsters, but it’s also about doing chores and waiting for your jeans to finish drying. The downtime phase lets you explore some of that thrilling mundanity as you take turns describing and roleplaying a few moments that take place back in Hillview in the week or so after your run, often prompted by beats.
- Beats are moments you can purchase with your trouble and style to fuel the story, advance your character, and prompt roleplaying scenes.
- The cost listed with each beat is the amount of style or trouble you clear to buy it.
- You can always purchase trouble-cost beats even if you can’t afford them. Your funeral, friendo.
- Trait and arc beats are one-time buys. Arc beats must also be bought in descending order, and only once per downtime. These limits don’t apply to any other beats. Buy six In the Labs at once for all I care.


> [!tip] Freeform Roleplaying
> During the freeform roleplaying of the downtime phase, you become the director of your own scenes. Forget the dice and just tell us a story. The GM and other players are there to assist you. Tell them your vision and ask them for ideas. Answer their questions. Cast them as NPCs and perform the scene like actors in a movie. If performance isn’t your thing, go the other way and describe the scene like a writer would, adding details and showing us what the characters’ are thinking and feeling.

## Trait Beats

Cartwheeling through unstable portals into cuckoo-banana-land with your friends may not be the most efficient path to college admission, but it certainly teaches you a lot about who you are!
- **Origin Story (3 style).** A flashback that shows a defining moment from your past. +1 trait.
- **Sharpened (4 style).** A teammate inspires you or shows you something about yourself. +1 trait.

## Family Arc

Slugblasting is not exactly embraced by society. As with underage drinking, rap music, or eating tide pods, opinions can vary wildly—the moral panic of the century, a thorny societal issue, or just kids being kids. But even if your family is completely checked out or astoundingly permissive, there’s always some way to get in trouble.
- **Trouble at Home (2 trouble).** Your family disapproves. How? Why? Do you care? +1 slam (distracted, worried, etc.) and pick a teammate who notices.
- **Final Warning (3 trouble).** An argument, punishment, or ultimatum. What do they want? What do you? What don’t they understand? What don’t you? +1 [[Take Slams#^743c4d|doom]].
- **Last Straw (4 trouble).** Nuclear war, scorched-earth, and words you both regret. +1 slam (grounded, lost device, etc.) and +1 [[Take Slams#^743c4d|doom]]. What’s the crew think?
- **Redemption (4 style).** Who makes the first move toward forgiveness? What’s changed? How will you treat each other differently now? −2 [[Take Slams#^743c4d|doom]], +1 legacy or trait.
