- First, decide how much time the epilogue covers. The GM has final say. A year works well, but it could even follow your characters into adulthood.
- Then, each player rolls 1d6 per 2 [[Take Slams#^doom|doom]] to determine their epilogue’s low point and 1d6 per 2 legacy to determine their epilogue’s high point.
- Now, using those prompts, describe what happens to you in a montage. End on a high point. This is Slugblaster, not Sadblaster.


|     | Low point                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6   | A lasting injury. A broken dream. A future you can’t escape. Sent to juvie. A lost friendship. Something that haunts you. |
| 4-5 | A long road. A setback. Stuck in a rut. Grounded for a year. Difficult changes. Something ending.                         |
| 1-3 | An mild embarrassment. An amusing predicament. A looming threat. A nagging loose end.                                     |

| 6   | Living the dream. Popularity. Money. Lasting friendships. Or just complete happiness doing what you love. You get what you wanted most. |
| 4-5 | A new friend. An old friend. Reconnecting. Progress. Rebuilding. Keeping at it.                                                         |
| 1-3 | A glimmer of hope. An open door. A memory you’ll always cherish. Something that can’t be taken from you.                                |
