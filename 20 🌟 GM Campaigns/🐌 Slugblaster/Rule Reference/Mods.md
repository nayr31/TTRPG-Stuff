Listen, if you and that soldering iron behind your back are going to so flagrantly void the warranty of your new greymarket nonsense device, I canâ€™t stop you. All I can do is provide you with information and support and pray I raised you to respect the laws of physics.

- Mods expand the functions and power of your signature device.
- Each mod costs a certain number of components, detailed in its description.

## Components

Components are an abstract representation of the parts you need. You can get them as a run prize, with the In the Lab beat, and from certain opportunities.

- **Lenses** represent various prisms, diodes, reflectors, optic siphons, photonic reframes, etc.
- **Coils** represent various tubes, wiring, servos, articulators, drive trains, coherence spirals, etc.
- **Discs** represent various circuit boards, processors, chips, cards, firmware, code blocks, etc.
- **Gems** represent various fuel cells, power sources, alien minerals, reality-distorting crystals, etc.

## Universal Mods

In addition to the mods listed in each entry, all signatures also have the following mods available to them.

- **Power Cell (2 gems).** Turbo gains 1 kick.
- **Stabilizer (1 coil, 1 disc).** Turbo gains 1 boost.
- **Kitbashed (varies).** Purchase a mod from another signature device.
