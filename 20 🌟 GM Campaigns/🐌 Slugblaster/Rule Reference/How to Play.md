You’ll sit down with 2–4 friends, this book, some pencils, some basic six-sided dice, and a few sheets you print off slugblaster.com. You can see an example of these playsheets on page 160.

One of you is the game moderator (GM). You’ll [[What a GM Does#^45cbe9|set up the game]], then help the others make player characters (PCs) and [[Crew Creation|form a crew]]. Then you’re ready for your first episode!

Each episode has two phases: [[Run Cycle|the run]], and then [[Run Cycle|downtime]]. One episode takes about 2–4 hours, and a full season can contain around 5–10 episodes.

Runs are the action part. Laser fights and hoverboard chases and wild parties. Every run has a goal, plus some obstacles the GM puts in your way. To overcome obstacles, you make action rolls (page 16) and the results will determine if you succeed or fail, and also if [[Take Slams|problems]] arise. You collect [[Take Slams#^6a31b5|trouble points]] as you try to survive and style points (page 20) when you do tricks and other cool things.

During downtime, you take turns spending trouble and style points on beats (page 22). Beats are events and moments that fuel the story, prompt freeform roleplaying scenes, grow your characters, earn you doom and legacy (pages 19 and 20) and get your crew closer to its ultimate goal— becoming legendary slugblasters!

At the end of the entire season, use the epilogue rules (page 28) to wrap everything up, and find out how the legacy and doom you collected impact your character’s future.

Then check out how to [[Do Stuff|do stuff]].
