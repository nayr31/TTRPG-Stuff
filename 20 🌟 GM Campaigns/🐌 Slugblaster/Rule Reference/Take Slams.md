## Problems

The airlock starts closing. You bail and break your collarbone. A [[metasaur]] starts chewing on your boyfriend’s stupid head. Slugblasting is a great way to avoid the problems at home, but a terrible way to avoid problems in general. You’re in for a world of hurt, a multiverse of hot neon tribulation. Isn’t that exciting!
- When you roll a problem, the GM either introduces a snag or hits you with a slam.

### Snags

Snags are twists and turns that make the situation more dangerous or complicated. An alarm goes off, the building starts collapsing, your ex shows up to the party, a monster grows a second head, etc.

### Slams

Slams are lingering problems that directly affect your body, mind, spirit, or gear. Things like bruised, exhausted, freaking out, humiliated, glitching device, etc.
- If you get slammed, write it in one of the slam boxes on your sheet. If you’re slammed and all the boxes are already full, disaster strikes! See next page.
- Slams clear at the end of the run, during clean-up.
- Some situational slams may clear sooner, if it makes sense. For example, if you took time to wash off in a (probably snake infested) river, you could clear that slimed slam you got trying to hug a snail.
- Slams don’t give penalties, but the GM might adjust the impact of your actions where it makes sense.

## Noping

There are endless possible ways to die, especially when you think it’s fun to sneak into other universes and rollerblade with monsters, but your story takes place in one of the few realities where you won’t. In Slugblaster, you control when and if your character gets hurt. So if the GM tells you that you break your leg, or get cut in half by a negaray, you can just say no.

> **NOPE!**
> If you don’t want to take a slam, say “nope!” and describe the cool thing your character does to avoid it instead. Then mark 2 trouble. (only for slams)

> [!info] Noping Forwards!
For players with improv experience, noping can feel like blocking fun moments. The trick is to practice additive noping. What cool thing does your character do just in time? What do we learn about them from how they avoid slams? > 

## Trouble

While you and your friends were laser-surfing through life sucking on redbull popsicles, your homework was piling up, your dad was worried sick, and your luck was running out. In Slugblaster, you can never escape your troubles, but you can swap and defer them.
- You mark trouble points throughout the run as you take dares, nope slams, etc.
- If you mark your eighth trouble box, disaster strikes!
- Trouble can be cleared by spending it on beats during downtime.

## Disaster
^3a093f

Everyone’s luck runs out eventually. Too many sketchy landings. Too many close calls with close monsters. Too much horseplay and too little respect for the rules of physics and probability.
- The GM asks each player to make a disaster roll near the end of the run (often on the way home).
- Disaster may also automatically strike in special situations, like if you mark all your trouble or take too many slams.

> **Disaster Rolls**
> Roll 1d6 per empty trouble box on your sheet. Take the highest result.
> 6 *Easy street.* Avoid disaster and mark 1 style.
> 4/5 *Close call!* Avoid disaster but mark 1 trouble.
> 1–3 *Disaster strikes!* Something [[What a GM Does#^97352d|really bad happens]]. Mark doom.

## Doom
^doom

Doom represents the scars and debts of this insane hobby. The bridges you’ve burned, the lies you’ve told, the dimensional horrors you can’t unsee, the hearing loss from that time with the matter-collapser. The things that follow you into adulthood.
- Disaster and certain downtime [[beats]] can give you doom. Write it on your sheet. Be descriptive.
- Doom can also be cleared with certain [[beats]], or by going on a run specifically for that purpose.
- Your doom helps determine your [[Epilogue|epilogue]].

## Fractures

Once you’re an adult you’ll get along with everyone and never be sad, but until then you have to deal with drama. The [[fame]], adrenaline, and relentless tentacles of slugblasting can strain friendships and tear apart even the tightest crews.
- Certain downtime [[beats]] and challenges can cause the crew to take or clear fractures. Write them on the crew sheet, in a fracture box. Be descriptive.
- If your crew takes a fracture when all fracture boxes are full, you break up. Everyone marks 1 doom and one or more PCs must leave the crew.
- Reconciliation requires a significant sacrifice, such as one member clearing some legacy or marking doom.
