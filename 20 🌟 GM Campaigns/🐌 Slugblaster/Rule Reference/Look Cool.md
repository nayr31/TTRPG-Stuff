## Style

As you may suspect from a game with locations shaped conveniently like skateparks and no mechanical penalty for not wearing your helmet, Slugblaster is not just about what you do, it’s about how. It’s kickflipping over that quantum centipede, and taking a selfie while you do it.
- You earn style by doing tricks, using certain traits ([[Character Creation|from your character sheet]]), and from style bonuses ([[Character Creation]], [[Crew Creation]], and [[Look Cool#^eba525|from your character sheet]]).
- You can spend style on [[Beats|beats]] that earn you legacy, unlock new traits, etc.
- Crew style is a single amount that can be split amongst you, or go towards buying things like fame.

## Fame

Your crew’s ultimate goal is to be famous slugblasters. To make it. To go pro. You may discover new universes, rescue endangered metaterrestrials from an invasive species, bring down a corrupt research group and forge friendships that last a lifetime, but if you don’t make the cover of Slugblaster Magazine, what’s the point?
- [[Fame]] measures how successful and well-known your crew is.
- Your crew advances in fame by unlocking a new tier with style points. There are six tiers, and each tier has a different cost, as well as new perk options.
- Anyone can choose to contribute style to the crew. This represents being a team player, repping your squad, and redirecting praise toward your friends instead of just taking it for yourself.
