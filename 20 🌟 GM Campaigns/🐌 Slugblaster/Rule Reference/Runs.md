- Each run should have a goal, a prize for reaching that goal, and at least one starting obstacle (page 146) you need to overcome.
- You can try for multiple prizes or some kind of extra big mega prize (double a normal prize or so). These runs should then be harder, with more starting obstacles or extra bite for the GM (page 137).
- Use the run and prize ideas included here, check out the featured locations for each world (pages 94–104), or come up with something yourself!


> [!tip] Player Driven
> Slugblaster is a sandbox-style, player-driven game. The GM doesn’t need to plot out a storyline or cook up a series of missions for the PCs.
>
> Instead, the GM describes the world like a playground, and the players swarm in and climb on stuff with their sticky popsicle fingers, driven by their characters’ goals and what looks shiny. They create the storyline. They think up the missions. The GM just offers a bit of guidance, a few obstacles, and a lot of consequences.
>
> If the players decide they want to find power crystals, the GM suggests where they could look. If they decide to throw a party, the GM thinks up some snags. If they tick off a faction, the GM makes sure that faction plots revenge.
>
> As John Harper says in Blades in the Dark, “Action, reaction, and consequences will drive everything.”
