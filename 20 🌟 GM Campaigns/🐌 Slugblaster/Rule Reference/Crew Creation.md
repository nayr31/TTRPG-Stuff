## 1 - Brand

Whether it’s how you consciously present yourselves, or just how people think of you, your brand can help set you apart. Pick two. The Guts has final say.
- **Shredders.** +3 crew style after runs where you race, chase, or land x-treme tricks.
- **Hackers.** +3 crew style after runs where you salvage parts or mess with tech.
- **Good Kids.** +3 crew style after runs where you help others or take a stand.
- **Punks.** +3 crew style after runs where you leave your mark or make a statement.
- **Partiers.** +3 crew style after runs where you throw a party or have a good time.
- **Weirdos.** +3 crew style after runs where you take an unconventional approach.
- **Couriers.** +3 crew style after runs where you deliver something.
- **Ultranauts.** +3 crew style after runs where you find a new world or deal with dimensional weirdness.
- **Underdogs.** +3 crew style after runs where you get in over your heads.

## 2 - Hangout

Sorry kids, you can’t always be in another reality. So where do you hang out when you’re not? Pick two. The Chill has final say.

| 5   | someone's garage | a church basement     |
| 6   | detention        | somewhere else        |
^hangout

## 3 - Starting Perk

Your crew is just forming, but you’re not full newbs. You’ve read the magazines, tagged along with the older kids, and have some hand-me-down gear. Pick either Masks or Advanced Portal Tech. The Grit has final say.

## 4 - Faction

You’re new on the scene, but you do have a few budding friendships and rivalries.
- **The GM** picks a faction already in your way (−1).
- **The Grit** picks a faction that trusts them (+1).
- **The Guts** picks a faction they’ve already somehow annoyed (−1 or −2, you choose).
- **The Smarts** picks a faction they’ve studied (+1).
- **The Heart** picks a faction that a friend or family member is part of (+1 or −1, you choose).
- **The Chill** picks a faction they know from being in the right place at the right time (+1).
- **The GM** picks any faction they want (−1 or +1).

## 5 - The Map

The multiverse is a tapestry of worlds connected by a maze of portals—scene secrets exchanged by word of mouth and posted in online forums like cheat codes. You’ve pooled your knowledge to sketch out some starting routes. Each of you draws a one-way portal between two neighbouring worlds. The Smarts draws two.

## 6 - Name your Crew

The hardest step. Relax. Use these tables for ideas, and take a run or two to decide if needed. But remember, if you don’t name yourself, the community eventually will. And it won’t be great. The Heart has final say.
