## Doing Stuff

This is an action game. It’s about blasting huge monsters into slime with colourful laser beams and kickflipping over quantum centipedes.

You make an action roll anytime you try to melt an android with your maser, hoverboard away from a logic storm, rummage through your knapsack for a spare battery, sneak out of your room without your dad seeing you, or do anything else where the outcome is uncertain and failure could be interesting.

> **Action Rolls**
> 1. Say what you’re trying to do and then roll a six-sided die (1d6).
> 2. If you get a 6, you succeed. If you get a 4 or 5, you succeed but there’s a problem. If you get a 1–3, you fail, and there’s a problem.
> 3. Describe your success (or failure). The GM describes the impact, as well as any problems, based on what makes sense in the situation.

6 -> Success
4 or 5 -> Mixed Success, you do it but there is a problem
1-3 -> Failure, you don't do it and there is a problem

### How much do you accomplish?

Your plasma wave hits, but how much damage does it do? You smooth talk the sponsor rep, but how much info does she give you? The impact of your action is determined by the GM, based on pacing, tone, and [[What a GM Does#^a95461|common sense]].

The GM might set up a [[What a GM Does#^444a46|progress track]] for tasks that are too complex, difficult, or interesting for one single action. With each success, you get closer to your goal, based on how impactful your action was.

### How bad are the problems?

In the same way, the GM also determines how bad any problems you roll are. Those problems are going to be [[What a GM Does#^6eb990|worse]] if you try something extra dangerous like doing a [[Look Cool#^eba525|trick]] or trying to go toe-to-toe with a monster you should be fleeing from.

## Doing Stuff Better

Slugblasters are scrappy, resourceful, and impossibly lucky. They get in over their heads again and again, but when they need to pull through, they usually find a way.
- Boost and kick are points you spend for one-time bonuses to action rolls. You can find them on your sheets (see attitude, pages 40–48 and turbo, page 50). The crew sheet also has some, which are shared by everyone (see hype, page 70).
- You can only use dare once per action roll, but there’s no limit to how much unspent boost or kick you can use. Dole them out carefully throughout a run or blow them all on a single epic action. Stack, mix and match, and go nuts.
- When you make an action roll with multiple dice, you take the highest result, ignoring the rest.
- Boost and kick are spent before the action is rolled.
- Your spent points refresh at the start of each run.

> **Boost**
> Mark a boost for a +1d6 to an action roll.

> **Kick**
> Mark a kick to increase the potential impact of an action roll. That kick remains spent even if the action fails. No risk, no reward, hotshot.

> **Dare**

| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| get +1d6 to an action roll       | let the GM gain +1 bite                                     |
| get +1kick to an action roll, or | let the GM introduce an extra problem, suggested by you, or |
| clear 1 trouble                  | mark 1 trouble                                              |

> [!info] What Kick can do
> - Mark more of a progress track or shoot down more laserflies!
> - Damage a monster with an otherwise ineffective attack. Punch that giant crab right in the nerve sac.
> - Get more style points when landing a trick (1 style per kick).
> - Gain some side benefit, or do a couple things at the same time.
> - And more! If it’s too much to ask from a normal action, add some kick and ask again.


> [!tip] Teamwork & Sharing
Teamwork is simple, flexible, and encouraged. As long as you can describe and justify it (for example, by being nearby) you are free to:
> - Use boost, kick, or dares to improve a teammate’s action roll. How do you help?
> - Freely take (or nope) slams for each other. How do you step in?
> - Share or trade components with teammates.
> - Donate style to the crew or a specific teammate. How do you give props, share the credit, redirect praise, gas them up, etc.? You can’t share trouble. That’s yours to deal with.
