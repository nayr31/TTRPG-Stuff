## The mindset

- **Be Curious.** Ask them questions. Give them problems you don’t know the answer to. Ask yourself what would logically happen next. Let everything flow from the fiction. Play to find out what happens.
- **Be Bold.** Paint the multiverse with colour and slime. Don’t be afraid to get weird. Surround them with alien landscape and lots of things to poke and play with. Make everything a skatepark.
- **Be Passionate.** Be a fan of these rascals. You aren’t their enemy, for you dump acid on them out of love. And when they roll 1s, don’t make them look silly— they aren’t incompetent, the world is dangerous.
- **Be Tough.** Make them work for it. If you say the slug will eat them if it catches up, don’t flinch when it happens. The PCs have plenty of resources for dealing with danger. It’s their job to save themselves.
- **Be Chill.** Hold things lightly. Go with the flow. Prep less than you think you need to. Leave blanks. Embrace the chaos. Say “yes and...”, and when you can’t, say “no but...” instead.

## GM Actions

Here’s a list of some things you can do, to help guide you until you get the hang of it.

### *At any time you can...*

- Describe their surroundings.
- Ask questions like “What do you do?” or “Who’s closest to the river?” or “Does that make your character mad?” or “How does the trick look?” or “Anyone have an idea for a problem?”
- Start a [[What a GM Does#^444a46|looming danger track]] or establish a future obstacle.
- Cut to the action, with the characters in control.
- Call for an extra refresh (page 13) any time during the run (helpful for longer [[runs]]!).
- Call for a [[What a GM Does#^c2bb7e|group action]]. This can speed up and simplify a scene.

### *When they roll a problem...*

- Hit them with a snag (page 146).
- Hit them with a slam (page 147).
- Or just gain 1 [[What a GM Does#^bite|bite]] you can use later.

### *Spend 1 [[What a GM Does#^bite|bite]] to...*

- Introduce a surprise problem (page 140).
- Cut to the action, with the characters in over their heads.
- Suddenly advance a threat (and the associated danger track)!

### *Spend 2 [[What a GM Does#^bite|bite]] to...*

- Force an immediate, additional disaster roll on a single PC.
- Introduce a random challenge to the crew (or pay a little more to pick something specific).

# Setup
^45cbe9

Setup is not the most glamorous part of a GM’s job, and certainly not as fun as dropping quantum fear-meteors on screaming teenagers. But someone needs to get this party started—and that someone is you.

## Before Playing

“Session Zero” is the name for the stuff that happens before the group’s first run. Making characters, getting on the same page, and getting ready to play.
1. Print the sheets (at slugblaster.com) and put them on your table with some dice, pencils, snacks, and your cat who loves lying on warm paper and fancies herself a gamer now omg what device will she pick?
2. Once everyone is done petting that chubby angel, briefly describe what Slugblaster is, using the intro on page 6, if helpful.
3. Set guides for tone and content in your campaign. You can use Script Change and the tone questions on page 142 to help.
4. Help players [[Character Creation|create their characters]].
5. Let each player describe their character, including their bond with another character. (Don’t forget Mrs. Whiskers and her wittle swugbwasting kitty eeeeee!)
6. Lead them through [[Crew Creation|crew creation]].
7. You’re now ready for Session One!


> [!info] Script Change

## Two Start Options

You can start them in the action, during a run. Starting this way is fun, saves time, strongly establishes the structure, and gives them a chance to learn the rules immediately. This is better for players who are comfortable with game mechanics.

Alternatively, you can start in town, before the action, opening on each character living their day-to-day lives. This option is slower, and you’ll be surprised how long players can happily play out mundane teenage life. It can require savvy pacing to get them to the run, but establishes the emotional core of the game and is a good option for players who are more comfortable with storytelling than game mechanics.

## Your First Run

[[Runs]] can vary greatly in length and structure from table to table, based on how long you have to play each time you meet, how long you want your campaign to be, how difficult you want the game to feel, how talkative your group is, how goal-oriented your players are, etc. There’s no correct length, and you will quickly get a feel for what works for you, but you gotta start somewhere, so here is a simple run outline to get you started.
1. Set a couple obstacles the crew knows they need to overcome to reach their prize. Start the run near the first obstacle, using either a quick travel montage or a jump cut (see page 140). This first obstacle might be exciting, but not overly dire or expansive.
2. Now ease up on the pace a bit and let them explore, talk with NPCs, etc. They may overcome more obstacles, and may even reach their goal. But then...
3. Introduce a twist or new threat that changes the nature of the run. A monster attacks, [[DARA|Rescue]] shows up, the universe starts collapsing, etc. New obstacles and goals may emerge, and snags evolve and intensify the situation, setting up the final set piece.
4. End with a big fight, a big chase, or something else action-packed and dangerous. You might even call for disaster rolls near the climax of this scene.
5. The run ends and the crew heads home, either victorious, by the skin of their teeth, or beaten and bruised. If you haven’t already, call for disaster rolls as they portal home, then make your way to the clean-up and downtime phases!


> [!question] What should I prep?
> Slugblaster was designed as a flexible, playerdriven, open-world game. It empowers improv, and also requires it. If you try to plan out the plot, either you or your players will get frustrated.
> 
> Many GMs find they need to prep very little for Slugblaster, but some feel better when they do or even enjoy the prep itself. If that’s you...
> 
> - Problems are the bulk of your job, so make it easier for yourself and jot some down, using the tables on pages 148–152 or the lists in each monster and world entry to help you. - Prep some NPCs. Pull some from a relevant faction, or make someone new. Think about what they want, practice their voice, etc.
> - List a few descriptive details for a couple locations you expect them to visit, including interactive objects or terrain.
> - Write a list of [[names]], tech jargon, and other things you find hard to improvise.
> - Read up on factions or monsters you may use, and bookmark pages you think you’ll need to reference, like a world you know they want to go to next.
> - Prep any music, maps, and images, you want to use. Finding good location images can make action scenes more tangible.
> - Practice a solid opening description. It hypes people up and starts your game off on solid footing.
> - Write down a few questions you can ask the players to get them moving.
> - Remind yourself what happened last game. It can help to ask the best note-taker in the group to do a recap for everyone.

# Pacing

Players are fully capable of controlling pacing themselves, and also fully capable of spending an entire session arguing about how to open a door. Historically, it’s up to the GM to keep things moving and provide structure to the game.

You can use your power as GM to speed up through the boring parts and slow down on the cool stuff. Skip to the action. Use montages. Start in the middle of a fight. Similarly, freeze frame cool moments and take time to savour them. Flesh them out, paint in detail. What kind of debris is floating around? Flower petals? Sparks? Droplets of slime? What graphic is on the bottom of that hoverboard as it flips? What colour are the laser beams?

## Jump Cuts

Your most powerful pacing tool is to simply cut to the interesting part. The first time they get invited to a party in [[Popularia]], the fun part could be getting there, a kind of Superbad homage. But after the first time it might make sense to just start the run with them arriving, in the middle of a dance battle, etc.

Similarly, while it can sometimes be fun for players to plan a heist, it can be just as much fun to smash cut to alarms going off, the character’s arms full of stolen components, being chased by guard drones.

Remember, cutting to desperate situations costs bite, and you should always focus on what your players’ are interested in. If they seem really excited about their heist plan, or picking out their outfits for the party, don’t skip it. Jump to the fun, not past it.

## Surprises

Surprises are big in pulpy adventures like these. I mean, what’s the point of giant sleeping monster eyes if they don’t slowly open behind a character mid-sentence? But they’re also a pacing tool. If a run drags or the PCs seem aimless, it can help if a giant horsefly grabs one and starts trying to drink them like a juicebox.

These shocks are thrilling and fun, but can sometimes feel unfair or unearned in roleplaying games. This is why surprises cost bite. Containing GM power helps the run feel concrete and winnable to the players, and frees you up to be maniacal without worrying you’ll overstep. Have a new threat suddenly appear, have a monster make an extra attack in a surge of anger, or have that approaching plasma storm build speed so the climactic escape feels perfectly timed.

## Group Rolls

^c2bb7e

If two or more PCs have the same immediate goal, the GM can call for a group roll, which is just like an action roll, except the results apply to everyone involved.

> 1. One player rolls for the group.
> 2. Anyone in the group can boost or kick that roll, describing how they contribute.
> 3. If the roll succeeds, everyone does, but any problems affect everyone equally.

Group rolls can dramatically speed up tedious or overly complex scenes, like when the entire group sneaks into a building, or a huge, multi-layered chase sequence. They are also mechanically powerful, so the GM decides when to use them.

## Tracks
^444a46

Tracks are tools to, uh, track what is happening in the game. They are concrete visual representations of situations that might be hard to picture otherwise. Instead of hitpoints, a progress track may reflect how close a monster is to death. If a storm brews on the horizon, a danger track reflects how close it is.

### Starting a track

The first track you set in a scene is a pacing decision. Should hacking this security door be a single moment, or an entire scene? That determines whether they solve the problem in a single roll, whether you set up a progress track, and how long that track should be. Every table is a bit different, and you’ll get a feel for it with practice, but a 4–6 length track is often a good bet.

### Adding more tracks

Once the pace is set, any new tracks used in that scene can be set relative to that first pace-setting track, and determined more by common sense. If fending off a 500-kg crocodile takes a 4-track, then fending off that approaching 900-kg royal crocodile takes longer.

### Marking the track

Tracks reflect what’s happening in the scene more than determine it. If the fiction changes, you adjust the track to match. Often this is when someone rolls an action, but not always. Use common sense, but here’s a guide:
- Successful actions make 1 mark on a progress track. More effective actions could mark 2 or even more.
- Danger tracks can advance steadily with time, or dramatically when there’s a problem or you spend [[What a GM Does#^bite|bite]].

### What tracks look like

- Clocks
- A word with letters crossed out
- Poker chips
- Checkboxes
- Points (3/5)


> [!NOTE] Perception Checks?
> Sometimes you want the characters to notice something, remember something, or receive some other kind of information. In other games you might ask for a perception or knowledge roll. In Slugblaster, just either give it to them (why waste time!) or give them a tiny thread and make them take actions to unravel the rest. “You just saw the bushes move. What do you do?” or “You remember reading something about this on a message board, but can’t remember the details.”

# Tone

Tone is tricky in Slugblaster. The multiverse is deadly, but the PCs don’t die. They have rayguns that could liquify a minivan, but they don’t kill people. They backflip over demigods, and also cry when their dad starts drinking again. It’s gonzo, but not silly. It’s Ninja Turtles, but not Bugs Bunny.

Everyone at the table contributes to the tone, so each table’s tone is going to be different. Some will end up with Stranger Things, others Adventure Time. I go for Into the Spider-Verse, but it’s your game and your job as GM to set the right tone for your group, and pull things back when they go off course. Here are some tips for how to do that.

## Do the questionnaire

Before playing, it can help to get on the same page, tone-wise. These questions cover some key issues you may face. Discuss them together. Answering with examples from familiar movies can help. You can reach for Indiana Jones to express the “horrifying-but-funny” way mercenaries might get eaten by giant slugs while the kids hide in the bushes freaking out, for example.

It’s okay if you don’t agree, it’s okay to not know yet, and it’s okay to adjust things later. The questions are meant to get you thinking. It’s better to discuss this stuff now than in the middle of an action scene. Otherwise you’re debating eel consciousness for forty-five minutes while Olivia is tired, Caleb’s trying to keep the scene moving, Noah has apparently just researched eel consciousness for a term paper, and poor Morgan just wants to know if she can shoot this eel or not.


> [!NOTE] Tone Questions
> - Does this look more like Stranger Things, Into the Spider-Verse, or Adventure Time?
> - Someone falls from 40 feet up, landing in some bushes. How hurt are they?
> - A kid tosses a salt packet from their lunch box at a giant slug. Is this a cute little joke or an effective attack? Could a monster be defeated through the power of song?
> - Do other slugblasters die? Is it urban legend or all too real? Do you attend the funerals?
> - Do adults like [[DARA|Rescue]] agents or mercenaries get killed by the monsters? Is it played for laughs, horror, or a bit of both?
> - Is it chill to blast a human, even non-lethally? What if they’re chasing you with a gravity net? What if they’re trying to hurt you? Can you knock someone out by bonking them on the head? Are they okay after?
> - Is it chill to blast a giant bug? What if it’s not even trying to digest you? What if you’re inside its nest? What about a psionic alligator? What about an octopus? What about a giant monkey? What about that giant bug’s giant larvae? What if the larvae are trying to digest you? What if they’re confirmed racists?
> - Is all this portal nonsense in the characters’ heads, like some big analogy for teen drug use or the arrival of the internet in isolated rural communities?

## Make it Gonzo

Listen, hard science fiction is great. Paper was invented so Neal Stephenson could use sixty pages to explain orbital mechanics. But that’s not Slugblaster. Slugblaster is about cool words and pretty colours. It’s about planar eclipses and neon slime. It’s about slabs of falling crystal landing to create a ramp at the exact moment someone needs to 360 over a chasm filled with pink lava. 

Most players are here for it, freed from the shackles of greyscale realism, but you can set them up for success, too. Give them big, slime-filled monsters to fight. Swap those human guards for a battalion of androids they can melt with glee. Build vibrant set pieces, with interesting props and terrain to interact with. Make everything a skate park, and turn fights into chases when possible. They aren’t just fighting Velocitaurs, they’re fighting them while trying to outrun a plasma storm.

## Keep it Grounded

You’re bound to get too silly here and there in your effort to be lit. When that happens, it can help to ground things with some mundane detail and emotional truth.

Yes, they have a negaray, but what does it feel like in their hands? How does it smell when it heats up? Yes, slugblasters call it [[Popularia]], but does it have another name? What’s the economy like? What’s that Arborist’s kitchen like? Sometimes a single drop of realism can be all that’s needed to keep you out of rubber-chicken land.

For the same reason, you can juxtapose the bonkers action of the run with mundane drama straight out of any coming-of-age story. These teens might be able to stop time and grav-jump over canyons, but their tech won’t save them from failing their chemistry exam, or that disappointed look from their father.

## Discourage Murder

These kids probably shouldn’t kill people, even if they deserve it. It introduces a level of darkness and moral complexity this game isn’t really built for. It bums Mr. Slugblaster out, ya know? Murder is not considered cool in the slugblaster community, and even using a non-lethal weapon against a [[DARA|Rescue]] agent may be seen as extreme. Certain crowds might like it, others might think it’s a woof, and hellfire will surely rain down in any case. Most slugblasters tend to run from [[DARA|Rescue]] agents. That’s just part of the sport.

The simplest and most foolproof way to handle this is to pause and remind the players that this is not that kind of game, remind them they have a stun setting, remind them they can run, and maybe give them a bunch of androids or pod-people to evaporate instead (they could just be getting bored).

## Don't Let Them Die

In the same way, these kids probably shouldn’t die. They may take hard slams, break bones, go to the emergency room, or have their reality mangled by a pandemonium ray, but having to go to a teammate’s funeral would dramatically change the vibe of the game. Doing that once might work for certain stories, but more than once and you’re playing something else.

Slugblasting is obviously mind-bendingly dangerous, but it also needs to stay fun for the game’s premise to hold. They should always have a way of just barely avoiding tragedy. They are the lucky ones. And if they get in a situation that stretches plausibility too far, you have an ejection seat—[[peelback]]. [[Peelback]] is unpredictable, tends to happen more during times of duress, and is still a super rough consequence, so it’s a good death replacement in this game.

# Decisions
^a95461

Part of the GM’s job is to be a referee. Use common sense, do what’s fair, and do what’s the most fun.

## Saying Yes

Guess what! You can say yes more than you think! This game works well with bold attempts and bizarre ideas. They still have to roll the dice, problems can still arise, and you as GM still determine how effective success is. So when in doubt, say yes and ask for a roll.
## Saying No

You say no to protect the tone, keep scenes challenging and honest, and maintain fairness. If someone has an idea that’s too silly, tries to stretch plausibility to resolve a problem too easily, or tries to bend a rule in a way that replicates a teammate’s ability, you should probably say no. Otherwise, again, I suggest saying yes.

### What PCs can typically do

| Activity                                         | Can they do it                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Climb a ladder?                                  | Yes, no roll needed                |
| Climb a ladder during an intense laser fight?    | Yes, with a successful roll        |
| Jump over a house with special jumping boots?    | Yes, with a successful roll        |
| Jump over a house without special jumping boots? | No, sorry. You are, in fact, human |

## Judging Impact

The players say what they do, the dice say if they succeed, but it’s the GM who determines how much they accomplish—how effective and impactful the action is. As mentioned on page 141, the first thing you’re going to consider is pacing. Do you want this task to take a roll or two, or be the focus of an entire scene? Once the pace of the scene is set, impact can be judged based on common sense:
- Is what they are trying reasonable or clever?
- Did they look for ways to get some kind of edge?
- Are they slammed with slimed and trying to climb a cliffside or trying to wrestle with a broken arm?
- Are they using the right tool for the job?
- Can you picture this working in a movie?
- Does it fit with the established tone?
- Are they adding kick?


> [!caution] Player VS. Player
> This isn’t a PVP game, but the nature of teenage drama means character vs character situations may arise. If so, don’t use the normal rules. Instead, ask the players to collaborate on the scene without dice rolls, in a way that reveals something interesting about both characters. This requires the players to be mature and flexible, which means it might not always work. Some players might just agree to settle it with:
> - A coin flip.
> - Rock, paper, scissors.
> - A “trouble bid,” where whoever is willing to mark the most trouble gets to resolve the scene their way.

# Danger

^97352d

This is the main job. You are a consequence generator. This is what you’ll spend the majority of your time and mental energy doing throughout a session—just coming up with an endless series of oopsies and ouchies for your little scamps.

It’s the hardest part of the job, but also may be the only truly vital part. A group of mature players can referee themselves, and even set their own pacing and tone. But it’s just not as satisfying to overcome an obstacle you set for yourself. They need you to be the bad guy, to give them what they can’t give themselves. You are their servant, and your job is to serve them plate after plate of trouble and snakes.

## Obstacles

Obstacles are the things on the run the characters need to directly overcome in order to get their prize. Unlike problems, obstacles and threats are established, known, or foreshadowed before they are encountered, often before the run even starts. Examples:
● The exact location of the prize is hidden or secret.
● The path to the prize is difficult, treacherous, blocked, or well-guarded.
● Earning the prize requires a series of difficult tasks, surviving a dangerous situation, winning a tough competition, etc.
● The prize must be claimed before a threat shows up, a window closes, or time runs out.

## Snags

Snags are special because they create more story—a new obstacle, a new threat, more things going wrong, and more fun for the players. Unlike slams, snags don’t get noped , since that would subtract upcoming fun. Snags are great for crafting and fueling fun action scenes and encounters. They can start the action off, then evolve and extend it. Examples:
● A new, unexpected obstacle or threat is revealed.
● A task gets more complex or difficult, with more steps. Start or extend a progress track.
● A situation gets more dangerous. Any future problems rolled are worse.
● A big twist changes the nature of the scene and what the characters need to do.
● An asset is lost.

## Slams

Slams however, are usually one-time stings. They’re a strong, simple option anytime, but work especially well when a scene is ready to end and you don’t want to extend it with another snag. Slams often represent physical injury, but don’t forget to also slam them with mental strain, exhaustion, emotional wear, damage to gear, and the like.
● Banged up, bruised, sprained ankle, scratched up, lightly roasted, slimed, exhausted.
● Stressed, upset, humiliated, distracted, confused.
● Reality damage, concept warping, unraveling logic.
● Drained powercell, glitching software, cracked screen, broken gun.
● Pinned down, grappled, stuck, targeted, dangling from ledge.

## Worse Problems
^6eb990

In extra dangerous situations, like when someone does a trick or doesn’t run from a big deadly monster, you deliver worse problems. This might mean:
- Two standard problems.
- Everyone gets slammed.
- Someone gets super slammed.

Super slams take longer to clear. The player writes the slam as normal, but with super (or some other intensifying adverb) in front. Super bruised, super tired, hella angry, etc. When it’s time to clear the slam, they only clear the intensifier. Super bruised becomes bruised. They clear the rest the next time. Super slams require extra noping to avoid. One nope avoids the intensifier, two nopes avoids the entire thing.

## Disasters

Whether exuberant debacle or sobering gut punch, a disaster should always teem with future story potential.
● Other severe outcomes like challenges or super slams can sometimes work as alternatives to doom.
● Disasters can be the direct consequences of the current scene, or be out-of-nowhere twists.
● Let the player write their own doom or veto ideas that don’t work for them. Don’t murder their parents or have [[peelback]] age them forty years unless they are into it. Be prepared to offer an alternative.

### Disaster Ideas

|     | Disaster                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 3   | **[[Peelback]] Damage.** [[Peelback]] pulls you home<br>violently, straining organs, altering physiology,<br>scrambling reality, or rattling your psyche.                                            |
| 4   | **[[Peelback]] Accident.** [[Peelback]] tosses you into<br>the multiverse, swaps you with an alternate,<br>shifts your timeline, opens a portal to heck right<br>where your bedroom used to be, etc. |
| 5   | **Capture.** You’re nabbed by [[DARA\|Rescue]] and hauled<br>in for treatment, pulled into an Arborist question<br>chamber, grounded until the rapture, etc.                                         |
| 6   | **Personal.** The last text you’d ever want to<br>receive. You get dumped. Your mom gets a job<br>overseas. Your dad finds your secret account.<br>Someone leaks that one video.                     |

# Scenes

A [[psionic crocodile]] attack. A hoverboard race through multiple [[worlds]]. The [[Wilkie's|PANIC Energy]]® beach party. No matter what the characters get up to, you can make it interesting, dangerous, and fun by providing compelling details, juicy problems, and maybe a track or two.


> [!NOTE] Journeys
> Sometimes a run is all about getting to a new world. Sometimes a run starts with the characters already there. And sometimes you want something in the middle—a quick travel montage of how the trip to [[Popularia]] went before the rave starts, ya know?
> - Ask one player to roll for the whole group. Everyone can boost or kick as desired.
> - On a 6, it’s smooth sailing! Have each player describe a fun moment from the trip.
> - On a 4/5, they all make it but [[take slams]] (tired, sunburnt, hungry, slimed...) or trigger a looming threat—an authority is tailing them, a predator followed them through the portal, Kit’s dad needs her home by 9 pm, etc.
> - On a 1–3, they don’t make it due to a big problem (monsters, gear failure, bad info, etc.) They might have to roll again, or the run may just veer in a new (worse) direction.
> 
> Longer journeys could require multiple rolls, if desired. For example, you could have them roll once per traversed world. (Just remember that these rolls can deplete the PCs resources.)

## Exploration

Slugblasting is often about discovery, and many [[runs]] include lower-adrenaline scenes where the characters spend time in a new area looking for a hidden portal, valuable salvage, ancient mysteries, or the way through to some legendary hoverboarding spot.

Also, in hoverboarding culture, time spent doing tricks at a specific location is called a “sesh,” and a lot of [[runs]] involve the characters simply trying to sesh a cool spot before time [[runs]] out or a monster shows up. You can use these exploration problems in those situations, too.

## Infiltration

A good part of slugblasting is getting into places you’re not supposed to. Hopping the fence into [[DARA]]’s facility, slipping past the bouncers at Matte Static, reprogramming a guardbot, hacking your mom’s email, and all that stuff. Make these moments into meals by:
- providing objects, terrain, or other fun details for characters to interact with.
- using progress and danger tracks.
- carefully inserting problems that increase the heat without boiling over right away into a fight/chase.

> [!danger] Cat and Mouse
Like chases, stealth scenes can work well with checkpoints, especially in scenes where PCs are evading a foe who’s actively searching for them.
> 
> Run it like a slow, tense chase. Set the stakes, danger track, and finish line, which could be as simple as a nearby door, air duct, portal, etc. The checkpoints might be things like a floor covered in noisy glass shards, a gap in the bushes, or anything that is hard to cross sneakily. Like in a chase, they still cross on a fail, but the danger track advances as the foe hones in on them.
> 
> Additional problems can be pulled from either the chase table or the infiltration table.

## Chases

A Slugblaster chase isn’t about gaining a lead or plotting out distances. It’s a side-scroller obstacle course of checkpoints you run through as a tight group while a monster breathes down your neck.

### Chase Checklist

1. Get things moving. Players can be reluctant to start fleeing, even when it’s clearly necessary. So here’s the trick. Just say, “It starts chasing you! Where are you headed?”
2. Set the course. Set a finish line (a thin-zone, place of safety, etc.) and some checkpoints (try 3–5). The amount should be known to the players, even if the details of each checkpoint are a surprise.
3. Set the stakes. Tell them what happens if they lose. Make it clear, severe, and something you can follow through on (two slams, losing their prize, disaster rolls, etc.) Set a danger track (try 3–5 marks long). If it fills, they lose.
4. Run the chase. PCs take actions to move through each checkpoint quickly. On a failure (1–3) they still move through, but slowly, which marks the danger track. Problems occur too, as normal.


> [!NOTE] Falling Behind, Splitting Up
> These chases are tight. The fastest crew member is only a short distance ahead of the slowest, so assume the crew is sticking roughly together. If the crew purposely splits up, the enemy picks one character to keep chasing, leaving the others free to hide, escape, or try something else.

### Chase Tips

● The checklist is written for being chased, but works for chasing others and racing others, too.
● Each [[🏠 World Database|world]] has a list checkpoints. Good checkpoints have hazards, choices, and/or things to interact with.
● [[What a GM Does#^c2bb7e|Group actions]] can work well for chases.
● By adding kick or taking extra actions, characters can try to do other things during a chase, like slowing the enemy down to clear some marks on the danger track by shooting, creating hazards, etc.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You don’t have a clear finish line. You need to<br>find it, open it, unlock it, etc.              |
| 2   | Your foe brings out a long range weapon, an<br>evolved speed setting, or a weird psionic ability. |
| 3   | The way you wanted to go is blocked. You need<br>to change course. GM adds checkpoints.           |
| 4   | Your board’s powercell is dying, you drop something<br>important, your path needs clearing, etc.  |
| 5   | You get slammed by a foe, a fall, or exhaustion.                                                  |
| 6   | Watch out! A hazard up ahead slams everyone.                                                      |

## Fights

Fights are often a run’s main action scene, when a player rolls badly and some huge insectoid bursts from its underground chrysalis. They’ll fight, then run from it, or fight while running from it. Slugblaster 101, right there.

● You can use multiple progress tracks with multiple paths to victory. Do they blast it to bits, or try to bring the cave down on it? Do they blow off the mech’s gun first, or focus on its powercore?
● Enemies may have immunities to certain kinds of attacks. This can make fights more interesting, as players scramble to work the problem.
● At the start of a fight, use problems to evolve the danger. The [[metasaur]] mutates, the microbot swarm self-replicates into a strike force, the slug immediately swallows someone whole, etc. After that, use problems to slam.
● You can have powerful monsters give out extra slams, or even [[What a GM Does#^6eb990|super slams]].
● Even if you aren’t doing a proper chase, you can make fights more exciting by having the battle move through multiple locations, using checkpoints as ideas for new stages in a shifting arena.

| 1   | Didn’t even flinch! The monster has thick skin,<br>regenerative tissue, a forcefield, or something<br>else that makes it tougher than expected.                                                                                     |
| 2   | Oh come on! More foes join the battle, a clock<br>starts ticking, this monster starts charging a<br>psionic blast, or some even worse threat looms.                                                                                 |

| 5   | You get slammed! (Slimed, jacked up, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6   | Splattering acid, a huge swing, an energy blast,<br>or some other area effect slams everyone here!                                                                                                                                  |

## Social Situations

Parties, concerts, interviews, photoshoots, high-stakes texting, and other social [[situations]] can be valid, exciting encounters with obstacles and danger.

Set up some progress and danger tracks. By making social goals and risks explicit, the scene comes to life and every decision matters. You could start with an “Impress the Sponsor” track, and then a “Sponsor Leaves Party” track. Throw in a “Group of [[The Mavens|Mavens]] Get Annoyed” track and suddenly you have the beginnings of a social minefield akin to reality.

And don’t forget to slam them! Slams can represent all sorts of social and mental damage, like embarrassment, confusion, over-caffeination, and stress. I mean, what’s more stressful than a party?

| 5   | You take a slam (stressed, flustered, confused,<br>embarrassed, angry, read-to-filth, etc.)                                                |
| 6   | You are interrupted by something bad. A monster,<br>a [[DARA|Rescue]] force, planar unraveling, etc.                                                |

## Downtime

Many players take naturally to downtime’s freeform roleplaying scenes, but some find them intimidating and will want a bit of help from you and the other players. You can offer ideas and insert descriptive details, but the best tool you have is questions.
- What beat are you buying? What’s it say? What do you think that looks like?
- Is this a montage? What song is playing during it?
- Where do you envision this happening? Your house? School? What’s the room look like?
- What is your character doing when the scene starts? Who else is in this scene? Should one of us play them? What are they like?
- How do you think that conversation goes? If we were watching it from outside a window, what would we see? Could we tell what was being said?
- How does your character feel? How do the others feel? How do we know that? How do they show it?
- Should we end this scene here? Or is there more we need to answer still?


> [!NOTE] Have an NPC Ask a Question
> A fun way to break the ice and get players roleplaying is to just have an NPC ask a question like:
> - Hi Steven, this is Lisa’s dad. She’s not answering her phone. Have you seen her?
> - Finally! You must be the band. Ready to rock?
> - Is everything okay, sweetheart? You’ve hardly touched your dinner.
> - Hey losers. What are you doing out here?
> 
> Nothing gets a scene started like a chance to tell a lie or trash talk some d-bag.
