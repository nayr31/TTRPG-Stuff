## The mindset

- **Be Curious.** Ask them questions. Give them problems you don’t know the answer to. Ask yourself what would logically happen next. Let everything flow from the fiction. Play to find out what happens.
- **Be Bold.** Paint the multiverse with colour and slime. Don’t be afraid to get weird. Surround them with alien landscape and lots of things to poke and play with. Make everything a skatepark.
- **Be Passionate.** Be a fan of these rascals. You aren’t their enemy, for you dump acid on them out of love. And when they roll 1s, don’t make them look silly— they aren’t incompetent, the world is dangerous.
- **Be Tough.** Make them work for it. If you say the slug will eat them if it catches up, don’t flinch when it happens. The PCs have plenty of resources for dealing with danger. It’s their job to save themselves.
- **Be Chill.** Hold things lightly. Go with the flow. Prep less than you think you need to. Leave blanks. Embrace the chaos. Say “yes and...”, and when you can’t, say “no but...” instead.

## GM Actions

Here’s a list of some things you can do, to help guide you until you get the hang of it.

### *At any time you can...*

- Describe their surroundings.
- Ask questions like “What do you do?” or “Who’s closest to the river?” or “Does that make your character mad?” or “How does the trick look?” or “Anyone have an idea for a problem?”
- Start a looming danger track (page 141) or establish a future obstacle.
- Cut to the action, with the characters in control.
- Call for an extra refresh (page 13) any time during the run (helpful for longer runs!).
- Call for a group action (page 140). This can speed up and simplify a scene.

### *When they roll a problem...*

- Hit them with a snag (page 146).
- Hit them with a slam (page 147).
- Or just gain 1 [[What a GM Does#^bite|bite]] you can use later.

### *Spend 1 [[What a GM Does#^bite|bite]] to...*

- Introduce a surprise problem (page 140).
- Cut to the action, with the characters in over their heads.
- Suddenly advance a threat (and the associated danger track)!

### *Spend 2 [[What a GM Does#^bite|bite]] to...*

- Force an immediate, additional disaster roll on a single PC.
- Introduce a random challenge to the crew (or pay a little more to pick something specific).
