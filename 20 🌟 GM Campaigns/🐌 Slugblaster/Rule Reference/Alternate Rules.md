## Adjusting the Difficulty

The length of your runs, the types of snags you introduce, and your table’s play style can all affect the difficulty of the game, so it may take a few runs to find the right difficulty level for your players. For further adjustments you can:
● add or subtract bite.
● add or subtract hype.
● adjust track lengths.

## Playing Longer

If you want to keep playing after you’ve become Legends, you have a few options.
● New Goals. Keep playing at full power, exploring the outer multiverse and saving up style towards a series of custom mega-achievements.
● New Sheets. Jump a year ahead, in a bigger pond. You were Legends in high school, sure, but now you’re freshmen at Popularia University or benchwarmers in the Wilkie’s Pro League®. So reset the crew back to Nobodies and start characters over with different sheets. Teens change and explore new parts of themselves.
● New Story. Play as your character’s younger siblings, slugblasters in a different Null town, or a group of Operaeblan teenagers fighting for their lives!

## Alternate Rules

Here are some examples of untested rule tweaks that alter the feel of the game. Use at your own risk.
● Noping Snags. Allowing snag-noping gives the PCs more power over the situation and the players more authorship in the story, but can more easily lead to blocking and fun-subtraction.
● Betting Style for Big Tricks. You can let players wager style points for big tricks. If they succeed, they double their bet. If they fail, they lose it for talking big game then embarrassing themselves. You might want to set a limit or things could get nuts—players can work the odds to their favour, plus there’s The Heart’s dreaded Middle Finger trait to consider.
● Flashbacks. Blades in the Dark veterans might want flashbacks reinstated, especially if their crew is pulling lots of heists and pranks. Allow PCs to spend 1 kick then describe and roll an action they could have plausibly taken in past.
● Crits. You can also add critical successes back into the game. If a player rolls two or more 6s, their action is more effective or earns them +1 style.
● Hype Generator. To keep the good times rolling, have successful tricks generate hype for the crew.
● Afterburner. To be nice, let them boost and/or kick after the action roll. This can give PCs another chance to succeed, or further amplify a success after the fact.
● Slams Deplete You. To be mean, but also add some verisimilitude, you can have slams also deplete some boost or kick, to represent the wear and tear on their body, mind, and gear.
● No Disaster Rolls. Disaster rolls add a push-your luck element to marking trouble, and provide a tense moment in the run’s final act, but they aren’t crucial. You can remove them if you want the game to swing less and be a bit less punishing.
● Beats During Runs. Allowing beats to be purchased outside of downtime can help PCs manage trouble during longer runs, and allows for fun moments like transdimensional phone calls from angry parents or big arguments between teammates while in the middle of a chase. You may want to upgrade the slams from some beats into super slams so they last long enough to have meaning. For example, a PC who buys Angst near the very end of a run shouldn’t be able to clear that slam a few moments
later.

## Other Settings

When I was ten I drew a comic called “Ray Gun Boy.” In college I dusted off this character for a short story exploring sci-fi wonder and mundane moments from my childhood in playful juxtaposition. I’ve now spent a decade steeping in this world, lovingly crafting each dimension, each faction, my passion steady, awaiting that rapturous day when I can share it with you.

But no, you’ve already used a razor blade to carefully remove Chapter 3 from the book entirely, ready to run Jet Set Radio Future or save some Tales from the Loop campaign gone off the rails. How nice for you. And how nice of me to allow and even encourage such disdain for my creative labour by listing below some ideas for alternate settings that require only minor cosmetic changes.
● Different Maps. Ditch the map and make the multiverse a sandwich, overlapping circles, layers of an onion, segments of a giant ring, cars in an infinite train, or just a different type of mosaic.
● Different Methods. Ditch the Nth gear and enter other worlds via wardrobes and mirrors, runic graffiti, vaping, strange buses at odd hours, answering blocked numbers, putting your shoes on the wrong feet, or any door you put your portal key into.
● Different Multiverses. Ditch the classic multiverse and instead be teen time travellers, explore other planets, jack into the metaverse, jump magically into the pages of storybooks, or use shrink rays to adventure in the horrid microspaces all around.
● No Multiverse. Ditch the multiverse entirely and rollerblade through the streets of Tokyo-to, play shows on Egress Station, explore the corridors of your Martian dome city, or skate the halls of the dystopic megamall your tribe has settled in.

## Other Stories

You can go further, tossing out gear and changing signatures to use Slugblaster to tell other stories about young people trying to balance their ambitions and messy home lives.
● Reskin Tech. Play as snotty adolescent demigods roaming Asgard, daring young inventors in easily scandalized steampunk London, or teenage warlocks flying illegal brooms through Onward’s New Mushroomton.
● Build New Signatures. Ride custom mechadragons, play as young cowgirls on magical pastel horses, or create signature powers to tell stories of aspiring teen superheroes à la Ms. Marvel or Kick-Ass.
● Play in Reality. Tell realistic stories of down-and-out skateboarders, aspiring young musicians, cutthroat teen influencers, and emotionally unstable first-year art students.
● Beyond! You’re in deep hack territory now, but I just know some of you are thinking, “this is perfect for my campaign about middle-aged spies surviving the desert.” Who am I to stop you? Enjoy, my sweet.

> Making your own signatures is easy! Reskin existing devices, rewrite flavour text, or assemble something new from various mods. Create a Quickmile BMX by rewording the Skipmode Runners. Use the Reality Cannon as Fey Magic and the Gravity Blaster as a Wand of the Wind God. Reimagine the Robotic Companion as your favourite digimon.
