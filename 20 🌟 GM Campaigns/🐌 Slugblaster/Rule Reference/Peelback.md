Just as spacetime tends to sew itself back up, the cosmic immune systems of these other worlds tend to spit out foreign objects. If you go too far or stay out too long eventually you’re forced back to your homeworld through a traumatic process called “peeling back.”

On the one hand, this means that it’s unlikely you’re ever stuck anywhere forever. On the other hand, peeling back is so unbearably intense that many teenagers hang up their boards after experiencing it. Without special equipment, adults rarely survive at all.

Much is still unknown about peelback. Why does stress seem to trigger it? Why does it only seem to affect life, and not that keychain from [[Popularia]]? Why did Nicole’s brother get flung into the astral plane for three weeks and why can he read minds now?
