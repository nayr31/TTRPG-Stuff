Inertial sweepers and momentum cells have been standard in hoverboards for years, allowing higher top speeds for classic kick-push decks. Only recently have slugblasters discovered that a little ballast-modification can break the laws of hoverboard physics completely

## Function

Go fast over solid terrain. Make your board super heavy at will, either as an effective attack or to protect it from theft.

## Mods

- **Proximity Lock (2 Discs).** Your deck returns to you, if possible. May require a roll if the path isn’t clear it faces resistance.
- **Stasis Anchor (1 Coil, 1 Gem).** Make your deck completely immovable, floating frozen in space, until you deactivate it.
- **Density Pedal (1 Coil, 1 Gem).** Roll to increase or decrease your own mass dramatically. Make your body lighter than air, make your fist heavier than uranium, and don’t let anyone push you around.
- **Inertial Vortex (1 Coil, 1 Disc).** Roll to subtract momentum from a room-sized area around you, slowing nearby enemies and objects. Alternatively, mark 1 turbo to avoid a slam from kinetic attacks.
- **Dimensional Ballast (2 Coils, 1 Gem, 1 Disc).** Roll to decrease your mass drastically by temporarily shedding some of your dimensions! Turn 2D and hide against a wall, or briefly exist outside time! Try adding a dimension even. Why not? You do you.
