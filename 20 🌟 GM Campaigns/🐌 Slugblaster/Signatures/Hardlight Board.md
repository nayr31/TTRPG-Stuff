Create a board made of solid, stable light with this wrist-mounted device. Out of the box, it’s basically just a standard hoverboard you can use as a nightlight, but a good programmer can unlock its true photonic potential. Hold onto your waveforms!

## Function

Go fast over solid terrain on a hoverboard made from crystallized light. Make your board non-exist and re-exist at will.

## Mods

- **Photon Vent (1 Coil, 1 Gem).** Roll to create trails of semi-permanent, slightly brittle hardlight behind you, which float in space until they fade.
- **Energy Lattice (1 Lens, 1 Coil).** Roll to reform your board into custom shapes, including tools, hand weapons, and other useful objects of a similar size.
- **Photon Exciter (1 Lens, 1 Coil).** Roll to damage things you grind, slide, ollie over, or just smack with your board.
- **Flicker Switch (1 Lens, 1 Gem).** Avoid a physical slam by marking 1 turbo. You blink out of existence for a second. What’s it feel like?
- **Matter Photonizer (2 Coils, 1 Lens, 1 Gem).** Mark 2 turbo to turn yourself (and your gear) into pure light. The rest of the world pauses. You can’t affect the paused world, but you can observe and move around in it. Time starts again after about an hour, or once you’ve moved 100 total feet.
