3D-printed armour, repurposed exoskeletons, and Slipmarket battle suits didn’t hit the scene until fairly recently, but their modular frameworks make them perfect for creative slugblasters looking to do something bespoke and original.

## Function

Nope slams from falls, crushing, hits, and other kinetic damage for only 1 trouble. Don and doff fast via an automated process.

## Mods

- **Heavy-Duty Servos (1 Coil, 1 Gem).** Roll to lift or carry very heavy things, slowly crush things in your hands, or jump great distances.
- **Weapons System (1 Lens, 1 Gem).** Roll to attack, at a distance or in melee, lethally or non-lethally, with either attack-speed blows or other weapons you design. What are they?
- **Mobility Boosters (1 Coil, 1 Disc).** Roll to go fast over solid terrain, via jet propulsion, mechanized leg engines, etc. Room for 1 passenger.
- **Ablatine Plates (1 Lens, 1 Disc).** Avoid one slam from physical damage. Resets during your next In the Lab beat. (Can’t stack with 3D-Printed Ablatine.)
- **Omega Engine (2 coils, 2 gems).** Mark 2 turbo. Your armour transforms for a few minutes, getting bigger, brighter, or cooler in some way. You get +1 kick on all related actions and can roll to create a powerful, room-sized force field which requires focused concentration.
