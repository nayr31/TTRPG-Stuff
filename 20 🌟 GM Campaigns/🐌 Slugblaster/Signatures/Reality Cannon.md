If you shine light through a kramshon crystal, you see a brand new colour. If you fire a high-powered beam of coherent photons through a kramshon crystal, you can scramble reality itself. And guess what! Most things, including monsters, are made of reality! Have fun!

## Function

Roll to scramble things with a powerful reality beam (either destructive and permanent, or unpleasant and temporary).

## Mods

- **Parameter Dial (2 Discs).** Roll to temporarily shift or calibrate minor features of a target, like colour, texture, volume, odor, temperature, etc.
- **Exponent Coil (1 Coil, 1 Gem).** Roll to temporarily create 2d6 alternate versions of a subject or object. They appear nearby. One is usually evil.
- **Subjectivity Diode (1 Lens, 1 Gem).** Create a temporary illusionary reality for a specific target. The effect happens within their senses.
- **Matter Lens (1 Lens, 1 Disc).** Roll to create large amounts of soft, amorphous matter, which coheres into random objects and terrain with time. Specific, complex, or immediate forms may require kick.
- **Concept Inverter (2 Gems, 2 Discs).** Roll to invert a target’s adjective—something “dry” might turn “wet,” for example. You choose. Adjectives are relative to yourself (i.e., an elephant is “big”). As always, substantial or dramatic results (“living” to “dead,” etc.) may require kick or multiple rolls.
