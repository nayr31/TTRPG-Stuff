Oh, gravity. Thinks it’s so tough, but even an entire planet’s worth can’t beat the static field generated by a balloon rubbed on your little sister’s head. But you gotta love an underdog, and with enough concentrators, exciters, and dilators you can still get this one to bark.

## Function

Roll to damage things at a distance with a blast of crushing force (or pummel stuff with non-lethal grav torrents).

## Mods

- **Endurance Engine (1 Coil, 1 Gem).** Roll to coarsely lift, push, and pull things at a distance, with the accuracy and power of a tractor.
- **Agility Pin (1 Lens, 1 Disc).** Roll to manipulate things at a distance with the accuracy and power of two human hands.
- **Impulse Rig (1 Lens, 1 Coil).** Roll to launch yourself high in the air, use your beam like a grappling hook, or give yourself a burst of speed.
- **Gravity Spasm (1 Lens, 1 Gem).** Mark 1 turbo to avoid a physical slam by creating a brief, invisible force field.
- **Field Inverter (2 Coils, 1 Lens,** 1 Gem). Roll to temporarily modify the gravity of a room-sized or smaller area you target with your gravity beam. Choose whether the gravity there is increased, decreased, reversed, pointing sideways, etc. Roll each time you want to change it.
