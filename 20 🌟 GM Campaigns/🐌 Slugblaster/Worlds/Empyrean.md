> *Untouched paradise. Winged deer drink from streams and wild pastel horses gallop over rolling hills of velvet grass. Be careful if you eat the berries.*

Acres of wild prairie grow on a wide loop of penrose ribbon, where you can hoverboard downhill forever and cool crystal streams cascade off the edge into the turquoise lake below/above. Where time moves at a different pace. Where a day spent here is only an hour at home and an eternity spent here wouldnâ€™t be nearly long enough.

In our infinite multiverse, is there more good than bad? More heavens than hells? Does the question even make sense outside the caged perspective of our four-dimensional minds? This is what slugblasters ask each other during sleepovers, lying on the grass under a dazzling mural of stars, the beauty of Empyrean softly whispering the answer.


> [!bug] Logic Binders Needed
> The strange laws of this paradise protect it from exploitation. Many governments and corporations have tried to establish a foothold here and eventually retreat. Without a logic binder, one can barely glimpse the light of Empyrean before peeling back, unsure if what they experienced was even real or not. Even with a logic binder, your trip is always shorter than youâ€™d like, although secret slugblaster lore says that the better you behave here, the longer it lets you stay. So respect the wildlife, pick up your pop cans, take only photographs and leave only grind marks.

# Featured Locations

- **The Meadow.** Bushes hang with a dozen varieties of berry and meadow seals sleep among the wildflowers in adorable fuzzy piles. Odd ampimeter readings birth speculation of secret portal-zones, arcane forces, and higher-dimensional beings.
- **Eternal Pastures.** Soft, grassy hills home to herds of giant bison and teams of playful mustangs. A rainbow of new colours arcs across an open sky scattered with dancing flocks of winged deer.
- **Allieâ€™s TurboSplash Waterparkâ„¢.** An abandoned [[Wilkie's]] project, now sunbleached and overgrown with prairie grass. Empty pools, weird exhibits, and a half-finished network of colourful waterslides await hoverboarders lucky enough to be here.
