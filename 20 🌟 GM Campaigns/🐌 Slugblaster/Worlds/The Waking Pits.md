> *Cold, dark Hell. A frozen landscape of crumbling castles and graveyards, lit entirely by lightning strikes and phosphorescent invertebrates.*

Ages ago the sky was blacked out and this place was plunged into frigid darkness. Mammalian life went extinct and everything else evolved to be chitinous and skittering, with antifreeze in itsâ€™ blood, surviving entirely through chemosynthesis or by sucking the soft stuff from the convenient hazwear packaging of wayward teenagers.

The Waking Pits is slugblastingâ€™s Mount Everest. Few spots are more dangerous (which has some intrinsic value) but the toppled turrets and snaking ramparts of this long-abandoned gothic-modernist civilization are a hoverboarderâ€™s dream, even if every other unholy molecule of this place is a total nightmare.


> [!QUESTION] Residents???
> Every kid knows there are vampires in [[The Waking Pits]], but few agree on what they actually are, since no image has ever made it online. Some say theyâ€™re highly-evolved bats, mutant mosquito men, or an alien race of hemophagous xenomorphs. Others say theyâ€™re a secretive gang of gothy, grey-skinned runaways from [[Operaeblum]]. And a few vehemently maintain that they are immortal ultrafiends, worshiping at the Cathedral to Super Satan.

# Featured Locations

- **The Doom Slalom.** Starts on the hilltop ruins of a flickering castle, winds its way through the breeding grounds and hunting territories of multiple predatory ecologies, ends in a flagstone megaramp over The Trench. Welcome to Hardmode.
- **The Trench.** The abyss of this abyssal plane. A deeper descent into alien madnessâ€”where logic unravels and nightmares wake and slabs of rotting masonry from collapsing bridges hang suspended in the tattered spacetime.
- **The Steeple.** A massive cathedral surrounded by acres of cemetery. Eerie frequencies thrum from within. A power source? Sub-woofers? The warped anti-hymns of a hive of metaterrestrial vampires?
