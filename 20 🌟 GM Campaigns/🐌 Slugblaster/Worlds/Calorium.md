The dying, late-stage sun of this world decided it would spend its last billion years boiling oceans, turning the beaches to glass, and filling the sky entirely. Whatever civilization used to be here has either fled or fried, and little remains aside from ash-white foundations surrounded by moats of hot neon lava.

Despite some economic potential, most view [[Calorium]] as just a big hot logistics problem, routing nightmare, and barrier to further interdimensional exploration.

But to a slugblaster, nothing is more metal.


> [!danger] Portal Rupture
> The intense heat of this plentiful armaggedon would be a steady source of clean energy, if not for the huge interdimensional power conduits required to pipe it back home. Many believe the problem can be solved, but impatient developers have already eroded [[Calorium|Caloriumâ€™s]] spacetime fabric enough that accidental, spontaneous, and difficult-to-close portals in and out form regularly, causing fires in neighbouring worlds.


> [!warning] HAZWEAR NEEDED
> Yeah, dude. Itâ€™s like a billion freaking degrees here.

# Featured Locations

- **The Gliders.** Dozens of glimmering foil air vessels circle lazily with no visible purpose or pilots, stuck in a powerful thermal column. Winged creatures roost, silhouetted against the oppressive white sky.
- **Soda Lake.** A natural skatepark of partially cooled lava formations forms the shoreline of these scalding alkaline waters. An audience of metaterrestrial flamingos watches closely. The deep part of the lake hides strange ruins beneath its roiling surface.
- **The Ziggurat.** This black zirconium structure shimmers in the heat, its origin unclear, its contents a mystery, and its architecture a dope array of skateable ledges, hubbas, and banks. Cursed markings herald the coming Omni-Sorcerer.
