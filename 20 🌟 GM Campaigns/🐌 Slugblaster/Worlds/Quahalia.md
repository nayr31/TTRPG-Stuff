Slugblasters are actually lucky to have so many relatively sensical universes nearby, considering the vast majority of the infinite multiverse is a tessellating sea of quantum noise—illogical combinations of mathematical babble. [[Quahalia]] is a stepping stone to that particular brand of fun, an eroding peninsula of quasi-substance stretching into [[The Noise]].

It’s a place many slugblasters find themselves. A place for thrill-seekers, those who seek answers, those who seek a new perspective, those who took an ill-advised shortcut, and those who just really want to nosegrind a dreamscape or meet a version of themselves from the future and maybe kiss them. What? Why is that weird? You’re weird shut up.

> [!bug] Logic Binders Needed
> Without a good logic binder, the boundaries between you and [[Quahalia]] start to melt away. Your body flickers through higher-dimensional geometric forms, your perspective warps and fractures, your neurons fire in reverse order as cause and effect rework their long-standing contract. If you’re lucky, you’ll peel back in a few seconds, although it may not feel that short to you. For as you know, eternity is not more and more years, but rather a single moment subdivided infinitely. What final, frozen thought keeps you company, washed smooth by lapping waves of forever?

# Featured Locations

- **The Orthoplex.** Impossible shapes overlap, reflect, and reform in this kaleidoscopic 5D playground. Strange control panels on hard-to-reach platforms can tweak mathematical parameters, unfurl new spacial dimensions, and create new worlds.
- **The Archives.** The flooding halls of an infinite library, where time flows strangely—slowing and reversing, swirling forever in whirlpools, stagnating in hidden alcoves, and escaping down seductive side passages into alternate timelines.
- **The Neb.** Memories, secrets, dreams, and fears tumble in this psychic nebula like traincars in a tornado. A shuffling obstacle course made from movie sets from your life, asteroid-sized personal possessions, dioramas of thought, and garish floats from the parade of you.
