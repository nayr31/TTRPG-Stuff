> *The ruins of an advanced civilization, grown over by dense, sparkling rainforest. Decommissioned gundam sleep under blankets of moss.*

For slugblasters, the Golden Jungle has always been a hotspot, in more ways than one. Hoverboarders are drawn to the dense foliage, geographical anomalies, and crumbling remnants of ancient architecture, which all add up to a sort of natural skatepark that is unrivaled in the local multiverse.

There’s also the inherent mystery of the ruins themselves, and the secrets lurking within the mecha, waiting for someone brave (or stupid) enough to come and claim them. Sure, the shadows beneath the jungle canopy hide creatures too vicious and terrible to even imagine, but what’s a slugger run without a little mortal terror?

> Don’t let the name fool you—the foliage in the Golden Jungle isn’t actually golden, though you’ll find just about every other imaginable colour (and a few unimaginable ones as well). No, this plane draws its moniker from the plethora of brilliant suns that shine constantly in the sky above. There is no night in the Golden Jungle, and the constant daylight combined with the moist, muggy air creates rapid, uncontrollable growth in the local flora.

# Featured Locations

- **The Praetorians.** No one knows how many of these huge bipedal battlecraft hide beneath the foliage, rusting away, just like no one knows who built them or why. The one thing that’s certain is they’re full of valuable components, if only you could get inside.
- **The Clearing.** This large break in the canopy is littered with highly-skateable and lichen-crusted wreckage—tempting, taunting, and utterly exposed to the watchful gaze of flying predators.
- The Chasm. An enormous scar across the landscape. Nothing grows along the scorched, crumbling cliffsides, and few know what’s at the bottom other than a thick layer of ominous fog. Some say it holds the answer to what happened here. Everyone says it’s way too wide to jump across on a hoverboard, but you can’t help but wonder...
