If Null is at one end of some sort of interdimensional coolness spectrum, [[Popularia]] is at the other. It’s where slugblasting first started, back when overclocking a hoverboard’s Nth gear to burn through the fabric of reality itself sounded like a bunch of science fiction nonsense.

Boring just doesn’t exist in [[Popularia]]. There’s always a killer party in the dorms, or a secret show in a disused Miper warehouse, or an underground tournament on the beach at midnight. You just have to know the right people to get in (or know how to not get caught).

This is the big pond, fishies. Where you go to prove yourself, make connections, and go viral. It’s also where about a million crews have burned out, broken up, and quit the scene forever. But that’s not gonna happen to you… right?


> [!info] Residents
> Popularians are beautiful, well-dressed people with brightly-coloured skin and hair. Youth in happy, closed friend-groups rule over beaches, pizza shops, and campuses, while [[Popularia|Popularia’s]] adults relax poolside in stunning villas, greenlight billion dollar movies, curate art galleries, and design the future with fellow members of the intelligentsia, sipping beverages that will be trendy in [[Hillview]] two decades from now.

# Featured Locations

- **The Beach.** Swim, surf, and party among the hottest people in the multiverse, or skate the famous boardwalk. Sure, there’s a [[Miper]]® store there now, but also [[FUST]], Infinite Pizza, and [[Scram Cat|Scram Cat's]] first mythic storefront, where slugblasting was born.
- **Popularia U.** Sure, you probably didn’t travel across 3–6 hostile planes of reality to slip into a class on Quantum Scattering Theory or Relative Multiversal Ethics, but the campus’s skate spots, lab tech, and elite dorm parties may interest you.
- **Downtown.** Go shopping, skate the M-train station, sneak into Miper’s corporate hq, or search for the elusive loft offices of Slugblaster Magazine.
