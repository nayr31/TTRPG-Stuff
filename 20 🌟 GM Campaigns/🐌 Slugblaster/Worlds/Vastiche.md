> *Chemical war badlands. Crumbling parkades, faded billboards, and an abandoned megamall almost entirely covered over with dunes of pink sand.*

Greenish clouds smear [[Vastiche|Vastiche's]] pale yellow sky. The landscape is dry and jagged, the air smells like chlorine and tastes like artificial sweetener—a byproduct of some sort of chemical weapon used during whatever global conflict turned this once-placid suburb into a wasteland of concrete and exposed rebar. Nothing grows here but roachweed and no one lives here except the packs of tumorous coyotes that scrap and cackle in the ravines.

Yeah, [[Vastiche]] sucks. But it’s easy to get to, relatively chill, and adults have virtually zero commercial interest in it—so it’s a good casual spot for when you can’t get to someplace better, and for slugblasters who are still getting a feel for the sport. Sure, it may be the bunny hill, but it still has enough skate spots, blank walls, military-grade salvage, and buried mysteries to make for a fun weeknight.


> [!danger] Bring your mask
> Whatever happened here, it left the air not great, although toxicity levels vary day to day. Most times a breath mask is enough, but caustic storms can blow in too, wreaking havoc on your eyes, skin, and the jacket you borrowed from your older sister without asking. Occasionally, the air clears up enough for you to ditch the mask entirely. On these rare nights [[Vastiche]] is alive with the sounds of partying teens.

# Featured Locations

- **The Overpass.** A river of abandoned cars rust bumper to bumper on a mile of elevated freeway. The windshields, on-ramps, and medians are fun to skate and underneath you’ll find shade, graffiti, empty cans, and hundreds of thrumming egg sacs.
- **Rainbow Tank.** Between the bombed-out remains of two big-box stores is a pockmarked graveyard of military vehicles, including a large battle tank covered in years of spray paint and railwax. 
- **The Secret Megamall.** The dunes occasionally drift enough to expose an entrance to this legendary spot. There’s a food court, a mini-golf course, extravagant water features hiding entire ecosystems under a layer of thick chemical algae, and even some alternate-reality stores and snack machines that haven’t been picked over yet.
