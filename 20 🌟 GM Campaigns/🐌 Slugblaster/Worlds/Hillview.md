Hillview was founded by pleasant, easily impressed farmers, who were seduced by the loam and spent the
next hundred years growing wheat, pumping oil, and rolling out fresh preachers from its seminary school.

Things changed more recently, when [[DARA]] surveyors discovered that Hillview’s remarkably thin spacetime
fabric and distance from important population centres would make it the perfect location for a big, expensive,
potentially volatile particle physics lab.

But despite the population bump, Hillview is still a town of just a few thousand, where you can walk from one
end to the other in twenty minutes and be offered a ride by passing neighbours three times along the way.
Where the summer evenings are long and cool, and you can ride your bike until 11 pm before the streetlights
even come on. Where the houses are modest and well-priced and there’s lots of good jobs.

A friendly town where you can put down roots and raise a family, which is, of course, exactly what 16-year-olds care about most.

> It took decades for the invention of the internet to change the average person’s life in a tangible way, to go from research paper to specialized technology to novelty item to something your mom uses to buy paper towel. In the same way, Null is in the uneven nascent stages of a new era, where it’s perfectly normal for slugblasters to own hoverboards and pocket-sized atom smashers, but also perfectly normal for the rest of Hillview to drive diesel pickup trucks, cook hashbrown casseroles in crock pots, and not be too sure about this whole multiverse thing.
