> *A bustling, exotic utopian city. Locals trade olives and spices in the forum, discuss the multiverse in ancient temples, and try to ignore all the ghosts.*

Visiting [[Thennis Spar]] for the first time feels like traveling to the ancient past and the distant future all at the same time. In the crowded marketplace, you’re as likely to find a cart full of fresh produce as you are a cache of salvaged alien tech. An ancient obelisk hewn from the living rock towers overhead, and at its pinnacle, a hardportal from [[Prismatia]] bathes the entire city in continuous golden-hour light.

Since most worlds are nothing but abandoned ruins and untamed wilderness, coming here often introduces Null’s sluggers to broader multiversal culture. This city can open up a lot of figurative doors and literal portals for a crew looking to make their name—just don’t get on [[The Arborists|the Arborists’]] bad side!

# Featured Locations

- **Arborist Temple.** Like everything in [[Thennis Spar]], this sacred site is both impossibly ancient and unbelievably futuristic. Word is that [[the Arborists]] are hoarding some serious tech in their inner sanctum (not to mention all the secrets of the multiverse).
- **The Forum.** You can find just about anything here if you know where to look, including strange delicacies, impossible wonders, and all the components and gear a crew could ask for. The question is: what do you have to trade?
- **The Catacombs.** In a city full of ancient architecture, the catacombs pre-date almost everything else by centuries. Secrets hide inside these winding tunnels, but who knows what else is waiting for you in the darkness. Finding your way in is difficult, finding your way out is even worse.
