- Is it a known place? How do people talk about it?
- A good Slugblaster world has things to hoverboard on, things to discover, and things that can go wrong.
- Write a quick list of potential problems and some fun chase checkpoints.
- Let the crew name it for you, if you haven’t already!

| 1 | The air here is toxic/hallucinogenic/caffeinated. | Gravity pulls from different points. | Something draws you to the centre. | Universe is 2D, like a sidescroller. | Time can be controlled through intense willpower. | Formed from your collective id. |
| 2 | The terrain is constantly moving. | Your tech struggles, lags, routinely dies | As you move further in, things lose detail. | Like your world, but if you’d made different choices | Time loop! | This is the inner landscape of someone you know. |
| 3 | Everything is on fire. It doesn’t burn, just looks rad. | Your tech gains power at a dangerous rate. | Structured like a ring, sphere, ribbon, box, etc. | Like your world, but in the past. | Dreamworld logic. | This is all a simulation. (What’s new, amiright?) |
| 4 | An active battlefield, apocalypse, or celebration. | Every smell reminds you of a specific moment. | Exists on or inside a colossal being. | Like your world, but in the future. | All your thoughts happen out loud. | What constitutes a swear varies moment to moment. |
| 5 | You can’t be hurt here. | You’re like ghosts haunting this place. | Exists inside a snow globe, terrarium, or diorama | Time moves slowly/backwards, but not for you. | Terrain reflects your mood. | Single episode genre-swap. |
| 6 | Gravity is weaker. | An enthusiastic audience you can hear but not see. | A familiar bedroom, but you’re an inch tall. | A day here is a minute at home. | Formed from the contents of your phones/pockets | You’re in a musical and only one of you knows this isn't normal. |
