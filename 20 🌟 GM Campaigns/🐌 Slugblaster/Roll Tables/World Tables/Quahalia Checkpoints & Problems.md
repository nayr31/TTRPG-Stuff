| Checkpoints |
| ---- |
| stairs to nowhere |
| a garden of forking paths |
| a turnstile of deep questions |
| a corridor you create with thought |
| a one-inch hole you can fit through |
| your bedroom door |
| take a moment to fall forever |
| the skatepark of your own body |
| a halfpipe, a 3/2 pipe |
| the terrain of dreams |
| a room from your nightmares |

| Problems |
| ---- |
| swarm of [[Omnimouth Horde\|omnimouths]] |
| you are all one being, thoughts colliding, each controlling a different limb |
| construct of darkening numbers |
| meta-structural failure |
| carnivorous terrain |
| part of who you are takes off running |
| foes made from your internal contradictions |
| red-hot logic binders |
| you think you're back home but you're not |
| the way out is deeper into [[The Noise]] |
