DARA (Dimensional Access and Research Agency) is a privately-operated, government-funded particle physics lab operating in Hillview. At best they provide scholarships and mentorship to young people, while their Rescue unit provides help to people in serious trouble. At worst they are a shady for-profit experimentation facility with an army of crooked spacetime cops.
