Shaking the scene and scaring parents across the multiverse, this throng of rowdy kids from [[Operaeblum]] is making up for their inexperience with raw talent, youthful energy, and a complete disregard for the way things are usually done.

- A way into [[Wilkie's]] CandyLab® through maintenance tubes
- The adoration of [[The Freaks]]
- A sponsorship from [[Hardecker]]
- A channel of videos that could turn your pastor grey.
**Likes:**
- Pranking/abusing their exhausted sponsor rep
- Crashing parties
- Not giving an eff
**Dislikes:**
- [[The Old Guard]]
- [[The Arborists]]
- Most Mavens
- Most other crews.
