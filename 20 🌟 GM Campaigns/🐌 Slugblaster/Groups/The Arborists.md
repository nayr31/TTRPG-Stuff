Summary: Ancient religion that believes in the "Great tree", with temples in [[Thennis Spar]].
Logo: "![[The Arborists.png]]"
---
Arborism is an ancient religion with temples throughout Thennis Spar, and likely beyond. They believe the multiverse is a great tree with many forking branches, and that they have been called to tend to it. At their best, they are spiritually-minded thinkers and philosophers, guiding interdimensional travellers with wisdom and protecting the multiverse from destructive forces. At worst they’re creepy cultists trying to control everything.

**Assets:**
Deciduum Temple (and all the advanced technology and multiversal secrets contained therein) and numerous secret routes and portal-zones.

**Likes:**
Balance, order, tradition, nature, sustainability, and nurturing the minds of respectful young people.

**Dislikes:**
Anything too disruptive, [[Doorways]], invasive species, anomalous quantum phenomena, and littering.
