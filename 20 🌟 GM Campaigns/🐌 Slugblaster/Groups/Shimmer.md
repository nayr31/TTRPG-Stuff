Summary: Transversal underworld criminal syndicate.
---
Shimmer is a transversal underworld criminal syndicate. At its worst it’s a hive of mercenaries, arms dealers, and thieves. At its best it’s your hive of mercenaries, arms dealers, and thieves. Like, nobody’s all bad, right?

**Assets:**
A fleet of killbots, a gang of toughs, corrupt board members, Rescue agents on the payroll, hidden smuggling portals, illegal weapons and portaling tech, and young sluggers unknowingly delivering contraband.

**Likes:**
People they can use, people who keep quiet, and scrappy kids who can break into places and might want to make a few bucks, huh? Whatcha say?

**Dislikes:**
Snitching, ingratitude, and disloyalty.

> [!caution] Mercenary
> Being an interplanar mercenary isn’t easy. The bugs are big, the pay barely covers your overhead, your joints don’t take portal static like they used to, and these teenage brats won’t stop getting in your way.
>
> - Protected by cool-looking battle armour.
> - Dope hand cannon vaporizes huge chunks of terrain and whoever doesn’t run.
> - Chases quarry with sweet jetpack.
> - Scans for body heat with wicked helmet.
> - Unsheathes negafriction knives, visibly weighs pros and cons of killing a minor.
