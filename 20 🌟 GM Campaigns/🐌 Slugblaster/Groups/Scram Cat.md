Summary: Inventor of the Nth-gear hoverboard. Basically invented slugblasting.
---
Before Scram Cat, slugblasting wasn’t much more than a few kids sneaking into [[Prismatia]] through mining portals. But with [[Scram Cat|Scram Cat’s]] novelty toy, the Nth gear™ hoverboard, everything changed. (The company’s name is so synonymous with the subculture that in some places slugblasters are called “scram cats” instead.) No company has the history, the respect, and the authenticity that Scram Cat has—which is exactly why [[Miper]] is set to acquire them later this month. I’m sure it will be chill.

**Assets:**
The most legendary slugblasting gear available, The Scram Cat X-Games™, a flagship store on [[Popularia]] boardwalk, years of hard-earned brand loyalty, a name inextricably tied to the culture, the blessing of [[The Old Guard]], a mountain of debt, and no other options.

**Likes:**
Crews who just love the sport, do big tricks on classic spots, break records, and try new things.

**Dislikes:**
As of next month, whatever [[Miper]] doesn’t like.
