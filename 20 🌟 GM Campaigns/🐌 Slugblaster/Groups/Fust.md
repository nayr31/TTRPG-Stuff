Soon to be the only truly independent slugblasting brand offering sponsorships, [[FUST]] is a group of diehard,
anti-establishment [[The Old Guard|Old Guard]] jerks known for refusing sales to moms looking for birthday presents and banning
kids from their store for not knowing what [[peelback]] is. Their sister shop, [[Infinite Pizza]], has been a slugblasting hotspot for years.

**Likes:**
Super dangerous runs, big slams, crews that DGAF, [[Null Range]], and [[The Wicks]].

**Dislikes:**
Goody-goodies, crybabies, sellouts, [[Scram Cat]], corporations, and all authorities besides [[The Old Guard]].
