---
A group of promoters, reviewers, burnouts, wash-ups, and geriatric twentysomethings who were doing this
when you were in diapers. At their best, they are mentors, rolemodels, and sources of inspiration and wisdom. At their worst, they are cynics, snobs, and gatekeepers.

**Assets:**
Powerful influencers and bloggers, slugblasting oral historians, a curated collection of skate shops and pizza joints, secret portals and hoverboard spots.

**Likes:**
Authenticity, respecting forebears, paying homage to slugger history, [[Scram Cat]], [[FUST]], and [[Null Range]].

**Dislikes:**
Arrogance, anything too disruptive to slugblasting fundamentals, [[Lazy Bunny]], and [[The Wicks]].
