This section outlines the structure of a typical narrative challenge. Beat 7: A Song of Personhood (p. 71)* provides detailed instructions for running the narrative challenge at the conclusion of A Siren’s Song. A typical narrative challenge consists of six steps:

**BEFORE THE CHALLENGE**
1. Gather Clues: Gathering clues should happen naturally as you play. Sometimes clues will be collected aimlessly or unintentionally since the players might not know to expect a specific narrative challenge. It’s up to the GM to collaborate with the players and summarize any pertinent information or common knowledge. Just before beginning a narrative challenge be sure to provide your players with a list of clues acquired during their adventure.

**BEGINNING THE CHALLENGE**
2. Determine the Goal: Next, determine a goal for the PCs. Goals should be simple but relevant to the scenario, providing both the players and GM the foundation from which to build the rest of the narrative challenge. A good goal involves the players taking some persuasive position. This is typically a position diametrically opposed to the goal of the relevant NPCs.

3. Establish PC and NPC Motivations: Establishing motivations for PCs can be easy. Sometimes they will defer to the group’s collective will, but some will have their own reasons for achieving a goal. Establishing PC motivations and revealing NPC motivations through narrative challenges can be the inspiration needed to engage players in more roleplaying. In the prelude to the challenge, pause and ask your players why their characters are motivated to achieve the goal. Provided below are some sample questions you can ask to kick start their creative juices:
- Do you agree with the goal? If not, why?
- Is there an NPC or fellow PC you feel needs your help in achieving the goal?
- Is there another goal your PC seeks to complete?

4. Determine Clocks: For the GM, its important to know the right number of clocks to use and the size of said clocks. Like in mech combat, balancing the capabilities of your PCs against that of their enemies is akin to setting the right size and numbers of clocks so as to present a challenging but ultimately completable challenge. The below list of narrative challenge complexity levels can be used as a quick reference:

> [!check] Tier 1
> Tier 1 challenges are typically those with 1–2 NPCs of medium importance who will give in to the PCs’ advances after only 2–3 successful checks. Oftentimes, it may not even be necessary to run these types of narrative challenges as a structured scene like the ones discussed here in this section.

> [!warning] Tier 2
> Tier 2 challenges are typically entanglements that require a substantial effort on part of the PCs to achieve their goal. Most narrative challenges will fall into this tier. These challenges involve complex negotiations with several opportunities for clues to be dug up and used. They should involve 3–4 NPCs with four- or six-segment goal clocks. Alternatively, these challenges might feature only one NPC who is especially difficult to persuade.

> [!danger] Tier 3
> Tier 3 challenges are pivotal situations in which the PCs are challenged to employ a mission’s worth of clues and knowledge of NPC motivations to achieve a grand goal. A tier 3 challenge takes place at the end of A Siren’s Song, featuring the Bondless and CHAGA. Tier 3 narrative challenges should feature 6–10-segment goal clocks with an assembly of NPCs or 1–2 NPCs with steadfast motivations.

**RUNNING THE CHALLENGE**
5. Roleplay and Make Skill Checks: During this step the players and NPCs engage in a loose turn-by-turn dialogue in which the players make skill checks. At each point, they should start by stating their intent to roll and the specific goal clock they want to fill. After this, each player should get an opportunity to make a roll until they have each had an opportunity, after which another player may attempt subsequent rolls in a rotating fashion. Players may no longer make rolls once the challenge’s time-limit clock (or similar) has been completed. During these step, encourage the PCs to narrate their rolls by having the NPC(s) speak and provide context. For example, when a player states their intent to fill a segment(s) in their group’s goal clock, you might choose to have the NPC antagonize them by saying, “You poor misguided soul, you do not know how wrong you are,” or something similar. Doing this allows both yourself and the players to provide gravitas to the NPC’s motivation or goal but also serve as an invitation for players to participate beyond simply making skill checks.

**ENDING THE CHALLENGE**
6. Resolve Motivations/Conclude Challenge: The completion of the PCs’ goal clock will result in the PCs achieving their goal. If time runs out and the PCs have only partially filled their goal clock, they should fail forward. Failing forward is where a failure has consequences that lead to some positive effect or outcome. Presumably they made some advances but fell short of their goal for whatever reason. Every narrative challenge will have a different conclusion. The end result of a narrative challenge is highly dependent on its complexity, and at the end of any given challenge there may be anywhere from 1–3 clocks showing varying degrees of completion. As such, it is exceedingly complicated to set strict win conditions. For this reason, this book doesn’t provide prescriptive rules for concluding narrative challenges. Only in the final narrative challenge of A Siren’s Song are specific win conditions provided. This makes it possible to present plot hooks for continuing the story beyond the scope of this supplement.
