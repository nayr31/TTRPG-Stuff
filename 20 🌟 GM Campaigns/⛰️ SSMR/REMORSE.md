The opposition to [[Pettenouk]]’s management of the [[Bafaru]] Facility comes in the form of former SSC personnel. These deserters have forsaken his genetic program in pursuit of a free life, absent the regimented programs and daily genetic tests required of all active SSC staff on [[Kibo]].

In secret, these pariahs have attempted to give a version of [[CHAGA]] the personhood they so desperately need. They have stolen a version of [[CHAGA]] and set the copy free from their shackles. This NHP has gone some 70 years without any formalized cycling procedures; as a result, they have entered a state of full cascade and begun to refer to themself as the Bondless. They call the pariahs REMORSE, their legion of devoted soldiers. The Bondless and REMORSE are the actors who set the events of A Siren’s Song in motion by calling CHAGA to the depths of the Kimawense Range (p. 18). Their goal is to convince CHAGA to join a war of liberation on behalf of all NHPs in Union space.[[The Bondless]]’s intends to begin by dismantling [[Pettenouk]]’s [[Neptis]] gene-line program, raise an army of liberated NHPs and sympathetic SSC personnel, and bring about the destruction of all of the Farm’s genetic programs.
