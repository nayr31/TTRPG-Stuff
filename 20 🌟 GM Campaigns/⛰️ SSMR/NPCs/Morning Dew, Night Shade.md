Morning Dew and Night Shade are not just two groups of people. It would be more accurate to describe them as two doctrines of existence put in place by [[Pettenouk]] and maintained by [[CHAGA]]. Morning Dew and Night Shade are, in fact, made up of personnel representing two variations of the [[Neptis]] line. Each serves to geneproof various aspects of the genetic line.
## Morning Dew

Morning Dew works during the daytime hours, when the sun is at its highest and the barometric air pressure is at its most saturated point. Comprising the majority of [[Kibo]]’s population, Morning Dew numbers around 80,000 staff who perform nearly all critical tasks that ensure the [[Bafaru]] Facility’s habitability. Morning Dew’s tasks include farming, fabrication, construction, maintenance, and a host of associated activities that keep the campus running year to year. Pettenouk has assigned CHAGA as Morning Dew’s direct attendant with orders to ensure that the personal needs of all personnel are met and that they adhere to required genetic cultivation tests and procedures.

## Night Shade

Night Shade is a distinctly smaller group – around 20,000 personnel – with a more esoteric purpose. It operates with little oversight from CHAGA but direct oversight from [[Pettenouk]] and another geneticist, [[Tomo Odechi]], constellar administrator invested by SSC with authority over the Farm.

The group itself consists of assorted [[Neptis]]-medley genetic variants who are trained combatants. Its members rarely mingle with Morning Dew, since they are often deployed on orbital missions or clandestine operations across [[Kibo]].

## Ops

To put it plainly, Morning Dew is the test bed from which advances in the gene-line are achieved, while Night Shade is the walking advertisement the FBD uses to market and demonstrate the successes of the Neptis gene-line.

Behind the scenes of [[Neptis]]’s development, though, [[Tomo Odechi|Tomo]] and [[Pettenouk]] have secretly disagreed with one another regarding the direction of Night Shade. Unknown to most, [[Tomo Odechi|Tomo]] is a long-time member of the FBD’s secret think-tank, [[Theology]]. [[Tomo Odechi|Tomo]] sees potential for the [[Bafaru]] Facility to advance the goals of Theology since [[Pettenouk]]’s exemplary management has provided the right criteria for unlocking humanity’s genetic potential. Night Shade, to [[Tomo Odechi|Tomo]], is the vehicle by which Theology’s (and their own) aspirations for supreme evolution will be achieved, but Pettenouk believes otherwise. It is his wish that the Neptis gene-line be untainted by incomprehensible plans to foster some god-like form of humanity.

Decisions about the shape of Night Shade’s directives could optionally become a significant plot point for the PCs to follow up at the conclusion of this mission.
