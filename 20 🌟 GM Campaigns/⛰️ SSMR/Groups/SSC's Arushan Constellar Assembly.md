SSC’s Arushan Constellar Assembly (ACA) is a digital nation that tethers the Farm’s many settlements and campuses together via one of Union’s most robust omninode networks outside of Cradle. Its purpose, outside of serving as headquarters for one of SSC’s major governmental bodies in the Orion Arm, is to provide a proverbial home for the many genetic programs of the [[SSCs Foreign Body Department|FBD]]. The ACA provides a place where personnel can coalesce, collaborate, and sometimes conspire against one another via their local omninodes. This is a grand undertaking; when counted comprehensively, there are millions of SSC citizens in the Farm.

Composed of many forums, lobbies, backdoor darkrooms, and virtual executive suites, the ACA serves as a vital respite for the often desolate and isolated personnel serving in active duty throughout the Farm.

On [[Kibo]], there is only limited access to the ACA. In order to maintain the sanctity of the [[Neptis]] gene-line, [[Pettenouk]] has closed off free access to the digital campus. His hope is that this will control external stimuli and any potential mutagenic variations due to unforeseen psychological exposures via the omninet.

At first, Pettenouk’s mandate was vastly unpopular within the Bafaru Facility, but with the departure of the pariahs and the progression of several program cycles, his wards have come to accept limited access to the ACA and the new way of life.

Despite limiting access for most of [[Kibo]]’s population, the ACA is the main forum used by [[Pettenouk]] and [[Tomo Odechi|Tomo]] to discuss the future of the [[Neptis]] gene-line and deliberate over offers and contracts from external parties requisitioning their specialized personnel. It is said that Theology operates beyond the bounds of the ACA, conducting its research without formal approval from either the ACA or Union, but the validity of this rumor has not (and likely will not) ever prove true.
