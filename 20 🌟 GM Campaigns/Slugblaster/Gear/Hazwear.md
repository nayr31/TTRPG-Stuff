The problem with portals is you might not know what’s on the other side. Will there be air? Will it be toxic?

And you can enjoy it all with the various skinsuits and motocross-inspired hazwear available for you really serious slugblasters to decorate with cartoon characters and spill iced coffee on. **(Costs 2 coils.)**
