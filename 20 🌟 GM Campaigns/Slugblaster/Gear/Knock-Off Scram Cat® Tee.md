If you look close it says “Scram Rat,” but that won’t stop this shirt from deflecting lasers just as well as the real thing for half the cost. Okay, almost as well as the real thing. Fine, 50% as well. I guess you get what you pay for, and you paid to get hit by twice as many lasers. You do you, man. Nope slams from lasers and other electromagnetic energy for only 1 trouble. **(Costs 2 gems.)**
