Muscus macrofractus can be found pupating in dank spawning ponds and crawling along ceilings on three dozen sticky tentacles. It’s a quantum being, and feeds on mathematically-potential matter. It’s huge compound eyes allow it to see a segment of your actuality spectrum— all the different versions of you possible—then forcibly actualize and externally digest whichever one looks tastiest.

- Rips a half-dozen alternate yous into existence (one of which often turns out to be evil).
- Gruesomely devours one of your alternates in front of you (actuality-shock, normal shock, etc.)
- Spews acid across the battlefield.
- Grabs you with adhesive tentacles (grappled, etc.)
- Carefully vomits digestive enzymes on your head, melts you and sucks you through a proboscis.
