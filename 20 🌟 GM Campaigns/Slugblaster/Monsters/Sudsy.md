Pigpens beware—Sudsy is coming. Most trace this soap monster’s origin to an industrial spill in Prismatia, but now it wanders the planes, leaving a trail of caustic foam, protected by a rich chemical lather, drawn to filth and scrubbing until there’s nothing but bones.

- Rushes toward you, swelling into a furious lather
- Vulnerable to oil and large amounts of water, but small amounts of water actually strengthen it.
- Drips through cracks, pours over barricades
- Soaks you with cleaning agent (slick, blinded, burned, corroded gear, etc.)
- Corrals you inside expanding mounds of thick foam.
- Envelops you fully then flees someplace it can clean that grime off your skeleton in peace.
