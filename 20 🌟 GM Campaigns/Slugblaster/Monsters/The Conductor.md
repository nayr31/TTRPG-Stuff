A malicious soliton from The Noise, formed from the angsty sonic-pollution left by the phone speakers and earbuds of an entire generation. The Conductor may manifest as a construct of pure distorted bass, a DJ on a killing spree, an insidious virus festering in your music library, or a garish poltergeist with a dripping baton.

- Generates hypnotic rhythms (dazed, puppeteered, etc.) and disturbing melodies (freaked out, sad, etc.)
- Pursues and haunts you on waves of sound.
- Nearly unkillable, but vulnerable to antiphase noisecanceling and full vacuum.
- Slams you with violent bass (bruised, headache, internal bleeding, etc.)
- Drags you into [[The Noise]] (page 106).
