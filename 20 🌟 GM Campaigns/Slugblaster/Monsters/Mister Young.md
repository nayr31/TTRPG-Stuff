It looks like a normal teenager, but itâ€™s actually an ancient being nearly as old as your parents. Mister Young drifts from world to world embedding among young people and feeding off their energy and optimism, on a mission to defy adulthood and grind the multiverse forever.

- Befriends, charms, becomes part of the gang.
- Quietly skims teen lifeforce (tired, bitter, etc.)
- Gets you alone and transforms.
- Takes a huge bite from your youthful exuberance (exhausted, despondent, etc.)
- Immune to physical harm, but vulnerable to being trapped, starved, or overfed.
- Chases you on his cursed hoverboard.
- Devours you entirely (mummified, nearing forty, etc.)
