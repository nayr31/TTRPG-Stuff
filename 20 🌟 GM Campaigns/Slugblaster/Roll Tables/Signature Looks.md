Each signature has a list of look options. Use those in combination with this table and your own imagination to describe your device. Is your gravity blaster a chunky plastic cannon, a glitchy 3D-printed powerpack, or a sleek metallic orb? Did you make it yourself or was it a birthday present from your rich uncle? Do you put [[Stickers, Pins, Patches|stickers]] over it? What kind?)
