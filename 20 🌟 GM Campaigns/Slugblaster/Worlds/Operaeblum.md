> *Three warring corporate megatowers, connected with twisting pedways and skytrains. Raves, androids, mirror shades. You get it.*

The multiversal conglomerates that own this triad of towering arcologies have been locked in war ever since an infamous three-way IP dispute involving animated unicorns. Resulting sanctions and blockades have turned a dense network of closed tubes and bridges between the towers into bustling neutral territory, where kiosks clutter walkways and restaurants serve street food out of permanently docked tramcars.

The din of rain and sub-woofer bass is punctuated by whoops from club-goers and the routine sounds of somebody committing a crime within earshot. [[Operaeblum]] never sleepsâ€”an eternal dusk-hour insomnia of sodium lights and flashing billboards, wet pavement and aluminum. Workers file into tubes, fat cats dine in leisure gondolas, and gangs on sport bikes race down ribbon roads of grav-fixed asphalt.

> Operaeblans have pastel hair and washed-out complexions. They wear latex and holograms and company-issued plastic one-suits. Cyberware is all but compulsory. Content is drip-fed directly to the amygdala to free up the frontal lobe for emails and deciding which company-issued nightspot you hit with your company-issued friends tonight. Work hard, party hard, outsource sleep to a neuro-linked surrogate floating in a napping tank on the tenement floors.

# Featured Locations

- **Matte Static.** The hottest club in the multiverse. Models push illegal flavours of PANIC EnergyÂ®, sponsor reps cut deals in the VIP, pros skate the portal-connected halfpipe, and every time the beat drops the dance floor is blasted with a flurry of caffeinated party snow. Must be legal drinking age.
- **The Drop Line.** This famous skate route starts off the M-train platform, snakes across a tangle of skyways, past the giant party windows of Matte Static, and ends with a faith-testing air drop into a supposed portal near the [[Hardecker]] mining floors.
- **[[Wilkie's]] Candy LabÂ®.** A grueling funzone, where indentured employees must eat only candy, shoot each other with foam darts, and party joylessly in 16-hour shifts as they roll out the newest in toys, games, candy, and slugblaster tech.
