> *Bonus world!*

Expansive nothingness, static patterns pulsating in the space between worlds. Shorelinesâ€”few and far between in this expanse of whiteâ€”appear as dark smudges. Thoughts like lost emotions. Masses only half-formed. Colors bleed into the ether the deeper you wander, until they become one with The Noise, muted and dispersed.

The Noise is only silent in its cacophony. The planes rarely collide here, but occasional whispers can be heard above the din. Blips phase in and out of existence, their flora and fauna displayed as strange molecular patterns. The stronger ones leave echoes of washed-out patterns that can be interacted withâ€” though caution is advised.

- Merchants and mercenaries called Glitches ride the tides of The Noise.
- The ether of The Noise has no form, but environmental fluctuations called Blips often grow into strange, unstable planes where none should exist.
- Sinusoidal oscillations produce haunting whispers like radio waves.
- The longer youâ€™re here, the more monochrome you become, eventually phasing out completely.
- Ion storms are common in The Noise, shaping and manipulating matter. These can create amplified Blips (known as Surge Blips), shattered planes existing only as long as the storm does. HIGHLY DANGEROUS!
- Smudges of fringe interference briefly assemble into flora, fauna, and otherworldly entities before either vanishing back into The Noise or growing into fully formed Solitons.
