> *An infinite ocean, with water where outer space should be. The serpentine glass corridors of an abandoned observation centre twist around a small coral moon.*

[[Desnine]] wasn’t always a popular destination for slugblasters—after all, nobody likes playing the water levels, right? Even with breathing masks, it makes for a dangerous run. Glowing coral and bioluminescent manta rays cast just enough ethereal light to find your way, but massive shapes drift through the inky blackness beyond, and they look hungry.

Despite all that, the discovery of the abandoned observation centre (and all that beautiful, immensely skateable glass) has redefined [[Desnine]] as a risk worth taking for a lot of crews. Just make sure your gear is waterproof first.


> [!caution] Weird Gravity
> The gravitational pull of an infinite tonnage of seawater on one side is opposed by the gravitational pull of an infinite tonnage of seawater on the other side, meaning the effective gravity everywhere in Desnine is about zero (except the artificially generated 1g in the observatory).

> No pressure changes, no diver’s sickness, air bubbles undulate in one place forever, things within those bubbles are similarly weightless, and heavily used portal-zones have accumulated large pockets of leaked extra-dimensional atmosphere over the years.

# Featured Locations

- **Observation Centre.** Miles of pristine glass corridors that twist in every direction. Flickering emergency lights illuminate steep drops, tight corners, and occasional full loops. A great place to score primo footage or find abandoned gear, but watch for cracked glass and flooded chambers.
- **Ethan’s Reef.** A coral moon home to hundreds of metaterrestrial species and some very mysterious alien wreckage. Named after that kid who went missing here. What was he looking for anyway?
- **The Bub.** This huge air pocket collects interesting flotsam from surrounding waters—things washed off sluggers and things from leagues away. Plus a few years ago a crew of shredders hauled a janky old grav unit in here that can be set to make the inside surface fully skateable.
