> *The plane of light. No sky, no ground, no up, no down. Pink clouds and giant crystal asteroids refract rays from a pantheon of distant psionic stars.*

[[Prismatia]] was the place of first contact between local multiversal civilizations, and has remained a vital waypoint during the decades of trade, cultural exchange, immigration, and adolescent truancy that followed. Whoever you are and wherever youâ€™re going, youâ€™re probably cutting through [[Prismatia]].

It has something for everyone. Abundant nonrenewables for hungry corporations. Alien ruins for hungry academics. A psionic cacophony for spiritual pilgrims and college-aged psychonauts. A drillable spacetime field for ambitious transit barons. Stunning views for wealthy tourists.

And for young hoverboarders, an ever-shifting airscape of ramps, rails, and mind-blowing gaps, all in a slurry of rolling spacetime and wonky gravity.

> Prismatiaâ€™s gravity (or, more likely, some kind of static-field equivalent) works a bit differently. Relatively small objects like asteroids or a large piece of debris each have their own 0.6 g gravity well, but this well quickly weakens and disappears even a few metres out.

>This means you can stand, walk, and skate normally on something the size of a shipping container, but can also break back out into zero-g space with nothing more than a solid jump

# Featured Locations

- **[[Hardecker]] Mining Facility.** [[Hardecker]] has been mining kramshon and farming polystellar energy here for yearsâ€” junking up the place with chutes, struts, conveyors, and an entire workforce of disgruntled, virus-riddled mining bots.
- **The [[Miper]] Train.** [[Miper]] believes their trillion dollar multiversal train network will bring the multiverse closer together and usher in a new era of peace and (for them) prosperity. Right now itâ€™s just a tantalizing, half-finished network of hardlight tubes.
- **The Wanda Curve.** An ancient, large-diameter ring of solid glass, thrumming with odd wavelengths of energy. Scientists and historians speculate on its origin and purpose, but most slugblasters just want to know if they can skate all the way around the inner edge first try.
