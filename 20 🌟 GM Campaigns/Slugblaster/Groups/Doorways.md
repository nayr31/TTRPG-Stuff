Summary: Parent group concerned about slugblasting. Safety equipment, or a mob.
---
Doorways is a parent group concerned about the negative effects of slugblasting on Hillview’s teenage population. At its best this coalition of involved parents provides education, supervision, and safety equipment to young people. At its worst it’s a mob of torch-waving soccer moms burning piles of Slugblaster Magazines and protesting near portal-zones.

**Assets:**
Boxes of tracts and pamphlets, a storage room in the school gym holding donated peelback kits and hazwear for safe-slugblasting campaigns, highly contagious outrage, many church basements, spies undercover as the “cool” teachers, straight-laced teen snitches, an elite neighbourhood watch.

**Likes:**
Safety, good rolemodels, and, inexplicably, Lazy Bunny, who they find wonderfully charming and polite, even if they can’t condone their lifestyle.

**Dislikes:**
DARA (for letting this all happen), Wilkie’s (who brazenly exploit this fad for profit), bad attitude, uncouth behaviour, and music with too much bass.
