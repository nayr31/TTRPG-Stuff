[[Hardecker]] had no idea they were in the slugblasting business, but have been reluctantly pivoting ever since their rugged outer-planar mining products were co-opted by the scene. They’ve begun tentatively making sponsorship deals, at least until their boardroom full of beige-wearing dads try to figure out why a bunch of teenage hipsters are buying out their P400 Duraweave Outwear Jackets and sewing decorative patches onto
them.

**Assets:**
Bizarre momentary cachet, various mining portals, SPM Kramshon and other mining subsidiaries, the Hardecker® Tools commercial line, the ill-conceived Hardecker® Fleek™ slugblasting line currently being focusgrouped, warehouses full of product, silos full of unrefined kramshon, and union-busters paid under the table.

**Likes:**
[[The Normies|Normies]], fiscal solvency, untapped revenue streams, doing legally fuzzy deals with Shimmer, punctuality, hard work, and advertising their powered weapon systems with slow-motion shots of sparks, sweaty brows being wiped, objects falling into beds of gravel, and dirty, calloused hands gripping mud-splattered heavy duty particle rays.

**Dislikes:**
Controversy, anything that’d make the shareholders nervous, anything too weird, improper use of equipment, [[The Arborists]], and cussing.
