Loners, geniuses, and kids with too much love to give all inevitably create signature devices capable of feeling things. Is it a hovering companion drone, a lumbering utility mech, an inflatable personal healthcare assistant, or something else?

## Function

As smart and loyal as a dog. Can follow closely, lift and carry things you could, communicate vaguely, and you can roll to have it do simple tasks, like fetch.

## Mods

- **Weapons (1 Coil, 1 Gem).** Roll to have your robot attack, at a distance or in melee, lethally or nonlethally, with weapons youâ€™ve designed. What are they?
- **Mobility Boosters (1 Lens, 1 Disc).** Roll to have your robot go really fast. Can carry a passenger or two. Ditch the hoverboard and hop on.
- **Heavy-Duty Servos (1 Coil, 1 Gem).** Roll to have your robot lift or carry very heavy things, slowly crush things in its hands, or jump great distances.
- **Guardian Mode (1 Lens, 1 Gem).** Mark 1 turbo to have your robot protect you or a nearby teammate from a physical slam.
- **Neural Network (4 discs).** Your robot now has the intelligence, communication skills, and common sense of a human child, and grows smarter and more independent each day. Mark 1 legacy. They grow up so fast.
