## Style

As you may suspect from a game with locations shaped conveniently like skateparks and no mechanical penalty for not wearing your helmet, Slugblaster is not just about what you do, it’s about how. It’s kickflipping over that quantum centipede, and taking a selfie while you do it.
- You earn style by doing tricks, using certain traits ([[Character Creation|from your character sheet]]), and from style bonuses ([[Character Creation]], [[Crew Creation]], and [[Look Cool#^eba525|from your character sheet]]).
- You can spend style on [[Beats|beats]] that earn you legacy, unlock new traits, etc.
- Crew style is a single amount that can be split amongst you, or go towards buying things like fame.

## Fame

Your crew’s ultimate goal is to be famous slugblasters. To make it. To go pro. You may discover new universes, rescue endangered metaterrestrials from an invasive species, bring down a corrupt research group and forge friendships that last a lifetime, but if you don’t make the cover of Slugblaster Magazine, what’s the point?
- [[Fame]] measures how successful and well-known your crew is.
- Your crew advances in fame by unlocking a new tier with style points. There are six tiers, and each tier has a different cost, as well as new perk options.
- Anyone can choose to contribute style to the crew. This represents being a team player, repping your squad, and redirecting praise toward your friends instead of just taking it for yourself.

## Legacy
^legacy

Legacy represents the lasting accomplishments, relationships, trophies, and memories from your slugblasting days. The fame and clout that follow you out of high school and the things you’ll cherish long into life, when you’re in your late twenties driving past the skatepark in your Honda Fit.
- You get legacy from certain downtime beats and [[Fame|crew perks]].
- Legacy may be lost due to disaster, or sacrificed to mend a fractured crew.
- The amount of legacy you collect helps determine your epilogue.

Style points are not just for pretty people in trendy sunglasses.

>Everyone has something that matters to them, and every subculture has something they think is cool. Skateboarding legend Rodney Mullen is a huge nerd. He isn’t known for his fashion sense or charisma, he’s known for inventing nearly every skateboarding trick there is.

> Beyond that, style points represent more than just superficial flash and popularity. They represent confidence, self-actualization, and personal achievement. Being cool is about embracing life and being completely yourself.

## Tricks
^eba525

Slugblasting, by nature, is about doing unnecessary things that are unnecessarily risky. Just for the lols, just for the likes, just to make your friends flip out, and just to see if you can. Although you can get style a few ways, tricks are really the backbone of Slugblaster’s style economy.
- These rules are for big, risky, attention-grabbing tricks. You don’t need to roll to practice a kickflip in the safety of your driveway.
- You can spend kick to increase the amount of style you get from a successful trick. Each kick spent awards +1 style, if the trick lands. Turn that boardslide into a switch-boardslide-bigspin-out.
- Slugblaster tricks are usually combined with another action, but you use the same rules for doing isolated tricks too.

> **Do a trick**
> Add a trick, a flourish, or some extra show to any action by saying “check it” before your roll. Any problems rolled are worse, but if you succeed you also mark 1 style.


> [!tip] "But no one was watching"
There doesn’t need to be an audience. Even a single gobsmacked witness can start a myth, and sluggers are constantly live-streaming, recording, and getting footie for their next edit. Besides, as mentioned, style is just as much about self-confidence as it is buzz. Anyone who survives a trip through a gravity worm’s digestive system is going to walk a little taller after.

### Trick Ideas

#### Board trick ideas
- Rotations. 180s, 360s, backflips, wildcats, mistys, mctwists, underflips, half-cabs, corkscrews, and other tricks where you rotate in the air before landing.
- Flip Tricks. Kickflips, heelflips, caspers, hardflips, treflips, shove-its, impossibles, and anything else where the board itself flips or rotates before you land back on it.
- Board Grabs. Tail grabs, nose grabs, melons, indys, mutes, methods, chicken salads, and anything where you reach down and grab a part of your board with your hand while in the air, often paired with a rotation.
- Rail Tricks. Boardslides, nosegrinds, 50-50s, crooks, feebles, lipslides and other tricks where your board makes direct contact with a rail or ledge as you slide along it.
- And much more!

#### Other trick ideas

Tricks aren’t just for hoverboarding! You can use this rule to add a flourish to all sorts of actions. The only limit is your imagination.
- Take a selfie while running from a pack of mathpanthers.
- Take a rad photo of a metasaur’s teeth, or your friends skating a gnarly rail
- Tag a wall with some next-level graffiti.
- Slap your crew’s sticker on a Rescue agent’s helmet as you sneak past him.
- Deliver a sick burn, or spit the illest punchline of the whole rap battle.
- Hold your laser pistol sideways.
- Make a wisecrack before punching a robot.
- Land in a three-point superhero stance.
