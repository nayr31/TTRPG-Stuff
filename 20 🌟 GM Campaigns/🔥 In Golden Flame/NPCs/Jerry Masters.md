Jerry Masters used to lead the Gate’s spec-ops team, but he stepped into the role of acting station director when the station’s previous director, Bai Zexian, vanished three years ago – although it’s more accurate to say that everyone else stepped back.

A pale, short, thin man with an untidy mop of brown hair and a twitchy disposition, Jerry doesn’t cut a convincing figure. This isn’t helped by his anxiety, his crippling insomnia or his selection of atrocious novelty ties. He always seems to be about thirty seconds away from a nervous breakdown.

Despite all of this, Jerry really is trying his best to keep the station running. He’s not afraid to make personal sacrifices for the good of the station – most often his dignity or peace of mind – and he has a good head for numbers and logistics. Under Jerry’s administration, people don’t get very much, but what they’re entitled to, they always get, no matter what.

On top of that, Jerry was – likely still is – a top-shelf mech pilot. He never talks about his past, but the half- dismantled Sherman Mk. I in the printer bay had to come from somewhere. An old callsign sometimes gets whispered in the Gate’s bars by militia members: Daybreak. And when the empty mugs really start to stack up, rumors fly about a team of DoJ/HR liberators and a doomed mission, once upon a time…
