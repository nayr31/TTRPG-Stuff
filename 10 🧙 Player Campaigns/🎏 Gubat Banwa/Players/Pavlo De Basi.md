Life Events:
- A person you loved told you the story of the Mahanaga, the great serpent that encircled the world and one could see at night as a streak of white, like a river of stars.
- You were born into great privilege and royalty: perhaps you were a son of a well-known Datu within Gatusan, or perhaps you were the crown prince of a Datu who serves the Sultana of Akai. Nevertheless, your privilege has blinded you to the truths of the world. What was the one truth that enlightened you?
- You killed someone in service of your lord. How has it changed you? You’re indebted to Sam’baha for helping you.

- Born in the grant capital city of Virbanwa into a well-off family who served a Datu as a second son, but the first never saw the light of the world.
- His mother was a Bloodbound, and served the Datu, while his father was a Worker. He was always closer to his father, who tended to raise the kids while they were young. The story he told about the serpent always made the sky look ever so reachable.
- Seeing the dedication of the family, the Datu allowed Pavlo to inherit some future responsibility on the battlefield, and learn from his seniors working as a Jr. State Kawal.
- As he grew with his siblings, watching over them and gaining the rights and authority of a true Kawal. 
- After a small raid on the city, by nothing more than mere idiotic bandits, he learned of just how scared and powerless the leader of the city was; hiding in this castle estate.
- My father was caught by another Kawal spreading misinformation about the Datu. However true it was, he was due for an execution. Getting in the way of this was the last this he should've done, as it led to the order coming towards him.
- Sam'baha helped him through this, gaining the strength and determination to make the call, and continue moving.
- The Datu is a fool, and no martyr. No person so great can make such bad decisions. My siblings have all left for marriage, but there is nothing left for me here. I haven't seen my mother in ages, who knows what happened. I will leave with what I have, and become greater than the Datu, greater than the serpent in the sky, and a ruler who can rule with purpose.
