**Charlie Reference:**
**Greatest Fear:** being alone/losing people (and cacti)
**Important NPC:** Avra/Chuck (his parents)
**Relevant Arc (optional):** something is **off** with him about Ellie. he made this friend just for them to leave? he probably has abandonment issues and doesnt know it. still glad to be back though (yea i realise this isn't an arc, just want something down for the future in case i think of something)
**Backstory:**

Charlie was born to Avra and Chuck Way. Once born, Avra, once a music teacher, decided to homeschool Charlie. That way she has more time to do what she loves: composing music (and spending time with her kid). Chucks business "skatewayz", a skate shop, was doing well, so they were never under pressure for money. He grew up surrounded by his interests (what his parents had him do - music and boarding), but never any friends. 

Getting into highschool, he knew he needed something to relate to the other kids about. The only thing he could think of was food and fashion. He was diligent, learned the "trends", and found good places. He was able to vibe well enough with people, but none of the circles he was in really "clicked", and never made a true "friend" that he could hang out with after school.

"Maybe an after school activity? Something light, like TTRPGs" he thought to himself, having no idea how heavy TTRPGs can be. This new club is around too!

He wasn't *alone alone*, there was always the nearby skate park with the older kids. But days go on and people come and go.
