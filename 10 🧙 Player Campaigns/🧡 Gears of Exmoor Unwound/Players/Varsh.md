> [!note]+ The Questions:
> - My order performs special death rituals that push the soul onwards at a much faster pace, hoping to outrun those who wish to pluck them from the other realms for nefarious purposes. *Once they die, let them rest.*
> - I stole command of a large mass ritual and ended up performing it wrong. Now, souls can be found chained to pillars in a square, screaming in the ethereal winds.

## Core Abilities
### DEATH FOLLOWS CLOSE
You never knew anyone could love you as much as your own death. You are followed around by a manifestation of your death that is invisible and intangible to everyone but you – although when you are on the verge of dying, or in places that resonate heavily with death and sorrow, it might be visible to others. The exact appearance of it is up to you. The first time each session you suffer Major Blood, Mind or Fortune fallout, your death manifests to protect you and inflicts D8 stress on whatever caused the fallout.

### ENTER THE GREY
You know the trick of stepping sideways into the Grey: the space between the worlds of the living and the worlds of the dead. Roll Delve+Religion to enact this ritual. It takes around ten minutes of preparation, e.g. donning ritual garb, inhaling sacred smoke, communing with your death and so on. On a success, the smoke clears, and you (and anyone you bring with you) are in the Grey.

Within the Grey, the world is a shadowy echo of its living counterpart. Some souls linger here, awaiting their eternal reward, but for the most part it is grim, empty and monochrome. (For more information on travelling and surviving the Grey, see p. 169.) Exiting the Grey is a simple enough task for a Deadwalker and those they ferry across; it’s a Delve+Religion roll for anyone else.

## Abilities

### SUDDEN DEATH (Major)
*Your soul is so poorly attached to your body that you can dive headlong into the Grey without warning.* 
**ENTER THE GREY** no longer takes ten minutes to cast – it is instantaneous. Bringing others along with you when you cast it in this manner makes the action Risky.

### DEATHLESS
*You’ve already died once; you can suffer through this.*
Gain the Endure skill. Roll Endure+Religion to ignore the effects of ongoing Minor Blood or Echo fallout until the end of the situation.

### LAST RITES (Minor)
*You know enough about death rituals to be sworn in as a priest in three major faiths.* 
Gain the **Religion** domain. When you touch the brow of a recently dead person, you can ask their spirit a single question before it fades away.

### GRIM REAPER (Minor)
*Your death has long whispered to you about the proper methods of execution; on occasion, it helps directly.* 
Gain the **Kill** skill. Your death’s attentions now function as the following weapon: (Kill D8, Ranged, One-Shot).
