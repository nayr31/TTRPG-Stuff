We are brought to a place, shops, markets.

A traveling menagerie is there too, and a red panda catches the others' eyes. Its half-jackalope, so Pandalope.

Blonde girl seems to own it. [[Retacon]] acquires a snail.
[[Aella]] seems infatuated, and receives a starter book to taking care of it.

I get a sprig of plant. Snail is named [[Blarko]].

[[Atlas]] gets a little black cat, no older than 10 weeks. It has wings.

[[Sky]] and [[Ash]] are the two girls' names.

Wall, cobblestone, more familiar to the ones form the past. There is a vast greenery around us. Long grass, only broken by stone fences.

Broken by the sounds of bodies toppling to the ground. 

[[Marcus]] remarks:
> Can't make it from the standard white stone, as repairing it is cheaper and easier. The attacks have been ramping up the past few weeks.

"Breach!"

The ground is impacted. [[Marcus]] is found injured, the wall is broken.

We push back the initial wave of sinspawn, protecting [[Marcus]] while [[Kira]] rebuilds the wall.

An echo of a connection to the sinspawn, the pain, the aftershocks

See a the energy move past her entire figure
Diamond in her chest

Led back towards the sinkeepers guild. A horde of guildmembers take the injured [[Marcus]].
