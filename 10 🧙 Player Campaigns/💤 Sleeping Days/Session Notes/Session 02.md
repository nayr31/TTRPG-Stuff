Previously, [[Rivis]] and [[Aella]] were sent through a portal into the future.

Time to get back!

(a small conversation with team 2, [[Radi]] and [[Atlas]])

[[Atlas]] plays rock paper scissors with a rock golem, while they get ready for the appearance of the archduke

Geo Astral Port System (teleporting?)

[[Kira]] takes us out shopping for clothes, traveling to the blitz train station.
She flashes a 4 ‚≠ê card and we get on.

Reach and dock to [[Gilra]]. Very green, dolphins and turtles use waterways to swim along (venice-esc.).
Stain glassed windows adorn shops instead of signs.

Potion bottle and wand, 3 story building.
[[Aella]] and [[Rivis]] come back in through the window.

Friendly introductions with [[Atlas]].

[[Marcus]] seems to be the person to talk to about getting people back home.

There is a journal (general Vex) to send the past. [[Sin spawn]] are horrific, twisted, once humanoid creatures who attack.
While coming into the city by train, we saw some clawing at the second arcane wall.

We are looking for an old, tattered, leather bound journal. The smuggler [[Vaughn]] has the journal.
