Born in the dark, to nothing. Darkness, danger, instinct. Living alone in such a dangerous world (especially for the rarely figured) is never good for one's sanity or health. To survive, it was skulking and sneaking in the shadows, stealing leftovers while digging tunnel network so hidden and tight that it was like home. Not all walls are diggable, and one bad target leads to prison. It was an odd experience. He was fed every day, without fail. The sense of calmness and certainty led his thoughts to calm and think about things, learn about the world. Although it was no criminal underworld, the life of prison-mates led to a vast knowledge of various topics (especially the underbelly of cities). He was too content, his death sentence was slated, so an escape needed to happen. With his skills (and a smuggled Earthglide Cloak from another prisoner), the escape was successful. He parted ways with his two compatriots, Ben and Margret (a dwarf couple), and now lives as a competent thief in the backstreets, easily avoiding detection or smuggling things for those who can pay. Old habits die hard.
