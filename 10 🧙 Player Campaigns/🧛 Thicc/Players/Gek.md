# Background



> [!info] Haunted
> You are followed by a spirit or entity, either from childhood or since a traumatic or momentous event. You may have seen this entity. Others may have seen it as well. You have studied esoteric subjects trying to understand your situation, but this presence in your life remains a mystery. Whatever this entity is or wants, it influences your life in subtle ways, not always good. Sometimes the entity helps you, but at other times, its influence is malevolent or harmful. The entity is most likely to surface in stressful situations.
> 
> Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or *Charisma*, and one is a free ability boost (*Dexterity*).
> 
> You are trained in *Occultism* and an additional skill in which the haunting entity is well-versed, determined by the GM. Any time you attempt a skill check for the entity's skill, the GM can offer you a +1 circumstance bonus to the check, as though the entity were [Aiding](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#aid_crb) you. If you accept but fail the check, you are [frightened 2](https://pf2etools.com/conditions.html#frightened_crb) ([frightened 4](https://pf2etools.com/conditions.html#frightened_crb) on a critical failure). The initial [frightened](https://pf2etools.com/conditions.html#frightened_crb) value can't be reduced by effects that would reduce or prevent the condition (such as a fighter's bravery).

## 1st

### Esoteric Lore

Your experience with the unknown, as well as the tales you've exchanged with other thaumaturges, has taught you about strange phenomena of every kind. You become trained in Esoteric Lore, a special lore skill that can be used to [Recall Knowledge](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#recall%20knowledge_crb) regarding haunts, curses, and creatures of any type, but that can't be used to [Recall Knowledge](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#recall%20knowledge_crb) of other topics. Unlike a normal Lore skill, you use Charisma as your modifier on Esoteric Lore checks. You also gain the [Dubious Knowledge](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#dubious%20knowledge_crb) skill feat.

At 3rd level, you become an expert in Esoteric Lore; at 7th level, you become a master in Esoteric Lore; and at 15th level, you become legendary in Esoteric Lore.

### First Implement and Esoterica

Your implement is a special object of symbolic importance: your badge as you treat with the supernatural and a powerful tool if things turn violent. Choose an implement. You begin play with a mundane item of that type, and you gain the initiate benefit for that implement. While an implement is useful to you, it typically has no value if sold. If you acquire a new object of the same general implement type, you can switch your implement to the new object by spending 1 day of downtime with the new item. As you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to suit your situation.

While your implements are your primary tools in your dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices: your esoterica. These might include cold-iron nails, scraps of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly from a saint, and other similar objects. You keep your esoterica in easy-to-access places on your person and are well practiced in brandishing your implement and esoterica together, so you can draw and use esoterica with the same hand you're using to wield an implement.

### Exploit Vulnerability

**Frequency** once per round

**Requirements** You are holding your implement.

You scour your experiences and learning to identify something that might repel your foe. You retrieve an object from your esoterica with the appropriate supernatural qualities, then use your implement to stoke the remnants of its power into a blaze. Select a creature you can see and attempt an Esoteric Lore check against a standard DC for its level, as you retrieve the right object from your esoterica and use your implement to empower it. You gain the following effects until you Exploit Vulnerabilities again.

**Critical Success** You remember the creature's weaknesses, and as you empower your esoterica, you have a flash of insight that grants even more knowledge about the creature. You learn all of the creature's resistances, weaknesses, and immunities, including the amounts of the resistances and weaknesses and any unusual weaknesses or vulnerabilities, such as what spells will pass through a golem's antimagic. You can exploit either the creature's mortal weakness or personal antithesis. Your unarmed and weapon [Strikes](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#strike_crb) against the creature also become [magical](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#magical) if they weren't already.**Success** You recall an important fact about the creature, learning its highest weakness (or one of its highest weaknesses, if it has multiple with the same value) but not its other weaknesses, resistances, or immunities. You can exploit either the creature's mortal weakness or personal antithesis. Your unarmed and weapon [Strikes](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#strike_crb) against the creature also become [magical](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#magical) if they weren't already.**Failure** Failing to recall a salient weakness about the creature, you instead attempt to exploit a more personal vulnerability. You can exploit only the creature's personal antithesis. Your unarmed and weapon [Strikes](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#strike_crb) against the creature also become [magical](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#magical) if they weren't already.**Critical Failure** You couldn't remember the right object to use and become distracted while you rummage through your esoterica. You become [flat-footed](https://pf2etools.com/conditions.html#flat-footed_crb) until the beginning of your next turn.

You can attempt to [Exploit Vulnerabilities](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#exploit%20vulnerability_da) in one of two ways: either by invoking properties that repel that type of creature, or by attempting a more improvisational, ad-hoc method with your esoterica that can impose a custom weakness on any creature, albeit one that usually isn't as dire as a creature's existing weakness.

**Mortal Weakness:** After identifying a creature's weakness, you use a thematically resonant bit of esoterica to attune your attacks to your discovery. Your unarmed and weapon [Strikes](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#strike_crb) activate the highest weakness you discovered with [Exploit Vulnerability](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#exploit%20vulnerability_da), even though the damage type your weapon deals doesn't change. This damage affects the target of your [Exploit Vulnerability](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#exploit%20vulnerability_da), as well as any other creatures of the exact same type, but not other creatures with the same weakness. For example, when fighting a pack of werewolves, you might use silver shavings or crushed moonstone to deal damage that applies their weakness to silver to your attacks against any of the werewolves, but you wouldn't apply this damage to any other monsters with a weakness to silver.

**Personal Antithesis:** You improvise a custom weakness on a creature by forcefully presenting and empowering a piece of esoterica that repels it on an individual level; for instance, against a tyrant, you might procure a broken chain that once held a captive. This causes the target creature, and only the target creature, to gain a weakness against your unarmed and weapon [Strikes](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#strike_crb) equal to 2 + half your level.

### Implements Empowerment

The power of your implement can also be turned to the more common task of combat, its power adding to and amplifying the effects of runes and other magical empowerments. When you Strike, you can trace mystic patterns with an implement you're holding to empower the Strike, causing it to deal 2 additional damage per weapon damage die. Channeling the power requires full use of your hands. You don't gain the benefit of implement's empowerment if you are holding anything in either hand other than a single one-handed weapon, other implements, or esoterica, and you must be holding at least one implement to gain the benefit.

### Thaumaturge Feats
At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a [thaumaturge class feat](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#blankhash,flsttype:class=1,flstclass:thaumaturge=1,flstlevel:min=1~max=2).
1st: [Diverse Lore](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#diverse%20lore_da)

> [!info] Diverse Lore
> Your wandering studies mean you've heard rumors or theories about almost every topic... though admittedly, your sources aren't always the most reliable. You can take a –2 penalty to your check to [Recall Knowledge](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#recall%20knowledge_crb) with Esoteric Lore to [Recall Knowledge](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#recall%20knowledge_crb) about any topic, not just the usual topics available for Esoteric Lore. Additionally, when you succeed at your check to Exploit a Vulnerability, compare the result of your Esoteric Lore check to the DC to [Recall Knowledge](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#recall%20knowledge_crb) for that creature; if that number would be a success or a critical success, you gain information as if you had succeeded at the [Recall Knowledge](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#recall%20knowledge_crb) check.

2nd: [Talisman Esoterica](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#talisman%20esoterica_da)

> [!info] Talisman Esoterica
> You know how to assemble the supernatural objects in your esoterica into a number of temporary talismans. Each day during your daily preparations, you can make two talismans with an item level no higher than half your level. You must know each talisman's formula. A talisman created this way is a temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations.
> 
> You know the formulas for [all common talismans in the Core Rulebook of your level or lower](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:crb=1,flsttype:,flstcategory:talisman=1,flstrarity:common=1). You remember your talisman formulas through oral tradition or mnemonics, so you don't need a formula book for them.

## 2nd

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a [skill feat](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#blankhash,flsttype:skill=1~archetype=2). You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

Skill feats: 

> [!info] [Intimidating Glare](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#intimidating%20glare_crb)
> You can [Demoralize](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#demoralize_crb) with a mere glare. When you do, [Demoralize](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#demoralize_crb) loses the [auditory](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#auditory) trait and gains the [visual](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#visual) trait, and you don't take a penalty if the creature doesn't understand your language.

## 3rd

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter (+1), you gain a [general feat](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#blankhash,flsttype:general=1,flstlevel:min=1~max=3).

General feats


> [!info] Title

### Lightning Reflexes

Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.

### Skill Increases

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.

You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.
