The origin of such creatures vary from location to location. In some cultures, certain bloodlines were given the care of certain animals to transform into and protect their land. In some, they were punishments bestowed upon them til the end of time. Regardless of origin, the result is the same; a primal, animalistic side that bursts forth in accordance with the moon.

Most of the Werebeasts are nomadic in nature, preferring to live in clans that travel depending on the season. The untethered nature of these clans helps curb the more animalistic side of them, particularly during a full moon. The clans are mostly what you'd expect; A Clan Elder, who protects and leads, the Chamber, advisors to the Elder, and the families that they preside over.
