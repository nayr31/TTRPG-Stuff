Summary: A community of werebeast leaders.
---
There were once strict leaders in the werebeast community, however the temperament of the population meant that these leaders were met with frequent assassinations and duels to the death. About 400 years ago, it was decided that one person holding all the power of the many beasts of the land meant that there would always be people left out. Instead, a committee was proposed. This committee would be made of regional leaders chosen and bestowed that right by their clans, and would together be the ones to head the Lunar world.

The Order is made of about 20 leaders of all different forms, and each holds the same amount of power as another regardless of territory size. Together, the Order makes the decisions on what laws the land must follow. As of now, the Laws are as follows:

1. Respect Each Other. Take no Action that causes harm to your fellow Beast.
2. Results of Combat must always be honored. This includes surrenders and duels to the death.
3. Protect your own. Do what it takes to protect your people. Desertion means death.
