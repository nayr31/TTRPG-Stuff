While there isnâ€™t much more that can be said about Countess Dracula herself, the same canâ€™t be said for her coven. The smallest and most secretive of the five, the Moon coven are only known to house the most elite vampires. 

In regards to their philosophies about feeding, they have no rules. 

For this coven, secrecy is key. Most of the members go undetected by the vampire population. Most members of this coven are perceived as Nomads, and there is a reason for that. The Moon coven takes in wayward vampires. Any who have found themselves without a coven, who need guidance, who need a place can find it under the Countess.
