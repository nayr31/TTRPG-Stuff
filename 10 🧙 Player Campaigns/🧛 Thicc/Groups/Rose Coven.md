With a name like the Rose Coven, one can hardly be surprised that charm and lust reign supreme. Mastery of the spoken word is a common trait every member carries. 

In regards to their philosophies about feeding, the Rose Coven hold a high standard. They only feed from mortals that devote themselves to coven completely. These mortals are held to impressive physical standard by Alistair himself. 

For this coven, they value poise. They are insistent on denying the monstrous nature of their transformation. They stand to prove that their transformation only elevated their life.
