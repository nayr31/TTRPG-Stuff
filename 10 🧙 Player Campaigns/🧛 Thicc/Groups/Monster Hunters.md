There is a belief that the fangs of a vampire, the claw of a wolf, the wings of a pixie, the eye of a cyclops, can enhance a mortal life without full transformation. Clad in black armor and even larger weapons, Hunters claim the lives of a large part of the Nocturnal population. With silver and poisonous herbs at their side, many fear the sight of their silvered blades aimed at them. 

While Hunters are a major threat, their employers could be even worse. These employers are people who want these creatures of the night dead or captured in order to research and experiment on them, potentially an order of hunters who consist of mainly alchemists who use heightened mutagens made from night creatures.
