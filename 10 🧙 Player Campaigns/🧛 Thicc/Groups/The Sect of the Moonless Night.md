Among the various clans of the Werebeasts are a religious group. This group takes to worshipping [[Oenta]], the Goddess of the Wild. They follow her teachings and her practices to the letter. Followers of this sect believe that by honoring and worshipping this goddess, their condition will be eased. They have a number of strange teachings and implementations that, while not outlawed, are still out of place for the Werebeast landscape.

Of their many practices, the most known is the Slumber. During full moons, followers will willingly take a potion that puts them into a deep sleep for the duration that the moon is high. Exact times of Slumber vary from person to person, with some only lasting the night and some lasting for the entire lunar phase. It is believed that by participating in Slumber, they grow closer to [[Oenta]] and their animalistic side will dwindle.
