HAPPY FEAST OF WINTERVALE

[[Devlin]] was escorted to the manner by [[Avina]].

> Southtown has the most greenery

Everyone meets in the lobby

Mr.Claus is an old friend of the employer
Runs the imaginarium
Makes toys, leading toymaker

[[Sirius Skyweaver]] has a hummingbird and dragon familiar

We take a car into downtown, to the imaginarium

Blood on the floor, and magic in the air, and an illusionary wall

Elves wants krampus and union, no unions here

4x2500Gp of diamonds, bottle of holy water (and one gift from Santa!)

New person? Death knight? Necklace?

Random guy we saved has [[Alma]]'s necklace? Real necklace?

Gabriel is the guy

Santa has been arrested
