Summary: Alma dies, the party disbanded.
---
[[Alma]] is looking for something necromantic? Something at the [[Hexrose Research Facility]].

The boxes last time had a [[cloak-of-elvenkind|Cloak of Elvenkind]], [[boots-of-elvenkind|Boots of Elvenkind]], and a [[sending-stones|Sending Stone]].
For me, my presents.

Haven't much time, need to go. [[Avina]] is in pain.

[[Alma]] takes the lead ahead after calling [[Devlin]], looking into the research facility.

[[Alma]] gets caught by two buff dudes, and gets shot down with a cold lance.

[[Devlin]] recognizes the name of the door of the place. "Jackson".

A battle takes place, an amulet arises, and [[Alma]] gets sucked into the amulet. She fucking dies??? \*Gets poke-balled\*
