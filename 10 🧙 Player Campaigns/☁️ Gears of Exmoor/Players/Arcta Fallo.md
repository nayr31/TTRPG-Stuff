# Background

Arcta was born into a family of skilled hunters in a quaint village, but managed to get by by selling rare materials to spellcasters and trader alike.

Now in his late 30s, he has inherited the family business and had devoted himself to the art of trapping. Although his parents disapprove the methods he has taken the business in, the success was there nonetheless.

The rapid improvement to technology has left little interested in the trade, and as such most of the skilled workers he hired quit, leaving him and only a few people. A big job, one mistake, and one lawsuit later it was all gone. His wealth, his business and his confidence to run something large had been shattered.

His name as a business owner tarnished, he was never able to open something up, or trade anything of value without being speculated as a con-man. A life of small trade, trapping, and hunting was what awaited him. It only took a few weeks to be sick of it, no growth, no big game, no one to share the life and passion. 

A ticket came in, and it was the call he had been waiting for. Nothing to pack, nothing left behind.

# Ranger

## Subclass: Trapper
> Through careful preparation, trappers can create both physical and magical traps to ensnare, explode, or enrapture those unlucky enough to find themselves in their vicinity. Trappers are found in all terrains where there are creatures to be hunted. With tact and guile as their companions, a trapper can lay low even the mightiest of prized beasts.

### Trapper’s Tools
*3rd-level Trapper feature*

Having learnt how to create traps, you’ve gained an understanding of how to thwart the traps of others. You gain proficiency with thieves’ tools and you add double your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using those tools to disarm or manipulate a trap.

Once per turn, when you hit a target with a weapon attack using the augmented weapon or ammunition, you can activate the concealed augment (no action required). The target of your attack takes 1d8 extra damage of the associated type. At 11th
level, you can augment one additional item or up to 20 additional pieces of ammunition when you finish a short or long rest, and the damage increases to 2d8.
### Set Trap
*3rd-level Trapper feature*

**Physical Traps.** Creating a physical trap takes 1 hour (which can be done during a short or long rest) and uses trap-making materials (valued in gp) specified in the trap’s description. After a physical trap activates, its materials are consumed and the
trap can’t be used again. However, over the course of 10 minutes, you can salvage half the trap-making materials used in the physical trap’s construction if it hasn’t activated yet.

**Magical Traps.** Immediately after you finish a long rest, you can create magical traps—up to a number equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1)—choosing from the options in the Ranger Traps section on page 188. Some of these traps require
you to expend spell slots in their creation. When you finish a long rest, all undeployed magical traps lose their effects.

While a physical trap’s description specifies how it is activated, you have flexibility in activating your magical traps. When you deploy a magical trap, you can choose a size of creature and a distance of up to 30 feet. When a creature of that size or larger comes within the specified distance, the trap activates. As another option, you can intentionally activate a magical trap within 150 feet of you using a bonus action or a reaction (with no specific trigger).

**Deploying a Trap.** As an action, you can throw a trap you have created to an unoccupied space you can see on the ground within 30 feet of you, where it arms itself at the start of your next turn. A trap deployed in this way is plainly visible to all creatures. Over the course of 1 minute, you can conceal a trap. A concealed trap can be noticed by a creature that uses its action to make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your ranger save DC and succeeds.

**Disarming a Trap.** Attempting to move an armed trap causes it to activate, unleashing its effects. A creature within reach of a trap can use its action to make a Dexterity (thieves’ tools) check (for physical traps) or a spellcasting ability (Arcana) check (for magical traps) against your ranger save DC. On a success, the trap is disarmed. On a failure, the trap activates and the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes to resist the trap’s effects. As an action, you can remotely disarm one of your traps that is within 150 feet of you.

**Trap Effects.** Spell effects created by a trap don’t require concentration. When a trap calls for a saving throw, the DC equals your ranger spell save DC. You can have multiple traps deployed, but any attempt to deploy a magical trap whose centre is within 40 feet of the centre of another magical trap fails. Creatures with truesight or that are under the influence of the detect magic spell can notice a magical trap’s presence, even if it has been concealed.
