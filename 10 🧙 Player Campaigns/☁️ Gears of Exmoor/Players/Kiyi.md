# Background

```
Some info about the lands and such -

In Infina, the conversation of magitech is extremely topical due to the world's best magical school, the Kijutsu Academy. A plethora of talented mages graduate the school on a yearly basis, and go on to innovate the world at large, creating several new technologies and sharing them with the world. On the other hand, many argue that the innovations taking place are against the traditionalism that Infina is steeped in.

Among the landscapes where this debate takes place is Shimoto. This city is at the base of a mountain and flanked by some of the oldest trees on this side of the world. Many myths take place in the forests adjacent to it, with the rumor of a Lifestream Spring being located there. Contrasting the ancient wood is the Kijutsu Academy that crowns the mountainside. Many students reside in the town, or on the campus itself, and during the term, Shimoto is brimming with life.

Kiya was born into the Purazuma family, a prestigious (and nearly royal) family that were renowned as great mages and wizards, gathering wealth in the process. This has mostly been foreshadowed from the advent of magitech. Due to their traditionalist lifestyle, all children are set on high pedestals and are sent to the top academy in the country: Kijutsu Academy. This fact hasn't changed even through the evolutionary teaching methods and resources provided to students.

Among her 2 other siblings (Morishita and Furuya), she is the youngest. The lax nature her parents set on her (or more accurately, the strict nature and attention on her siblings) caused an unhinged and free lifestyle without much morals. This slowly escalated through adolescence, and culminated in an abusive and destructive personality at the academy. "Snake's Tongue" was her nickname, derived for being able to lie her way through any authority that questioned her actions towards the other students.

After the death of a few students, a full scale investigation was performed by external authorities, and it was deemed that Kiyi was the culprit. Her sweet tongue with the professors and headmaster managed to grant her expulsion, but it didn't manage to get her parents to look over the fact - she was never to return, and to never use the Purazuma name again.

A few years have passed, and her exploits through various countries has left her with little to return to and little to show for it. Her magic prowess and innate talent from the academy and bloodline can only go so far, so when she got a letter addressed for "her eyes only", she knew she had to take it.

-> Potential rewrites

- Kiyi WAS a bully in school, and because of that used as a scapegoat for the real culprit of the incident
- After he expulsion/excommunication, she roamed the lands not having a clear direction or purpose, just using her talents to get by
- Only until she hit near rock bottom in a fighting ring did she decide that clearing her name would be the fastest way to get back to her lavish lifestyle back in Infina
	- She misses the soft winds under a cherry blossoms, the sound of ducks in the pond, the reality in knowing that she could sleep in her garden and nothing bad would happen
	- Every day is stressful. Wake up, make money to eat and a place to sleep, repeat. Every day. All profits went to healing remedies, repairing gear, or getting new tats
- After saving enough for provisions, she sets off for Chronovale to follow the letter she received. Perhaps the reward would be enough to allow her to set off in search? Maybe the people have the power to help?
