Summary: "[[Kira]] takes us to see her brother, [[Marcus]], where we meet up with [[Atlas]] and [[Radi]]. Prime plan: Get a journal from [[Vaughn]] which has info on getting back."
---
Previously, [[Rivis]] and [[Aella]] were sent through a portal into the future.

Time to get back!

(a small conversation with team 2, [[Radi]] and [[Atlas]])

[[Atlas]] plays rock paper scissors with a rock golem, while they get ready for the appearance of the archduke

Geo Astral Port System (teleporting?)

[[Kira]] takes us out shopping for clothes, traveling to the blitz train station.
She flashes a 4 ⭐ card and we get on.

Reach and dock to [[Gilra]]. Very green, dolphins and turtles use waterways to swim along (venice-esc.).
Stain glassed windows adorn shops instead of signs.

Potion bottle and wand, 3 story building.
[[Aella]] and [[Rivis]] come back in through the window.

Friendly introductions with [[Atlas]].

[[Marcus]] seems to be the person to talk to about getting people back home.

There is a journal (general Vex) to send the past. [[Sin spawn]] are horrific, twisted, once humanoid creatures who attack.
While coming into the city by train, we saw some clawing at the second arcane wall.

We are looking for an old, tattered, leather bound journal. The smuggler [[Bon]] has the journal.

We enter a "cave"? To get to [[Bon]].

Get to a secret base, with the guy and a cat??

We steal the journal and escape, with guy right behind us.

Warning shot and a quick convo later, we get back to the shop. He asked if we were associated with a "V".

Journal entry:
> Whoever said "The wise warrior avoids the battle" has never considered a war where one is fighting for one's very existence. If I had the choice to avoid the battles, I would, but these bastards keep coming. 
> 
> The King tells me that I'm their hope, their shining hero, the one who could do what they couldn't. He's wrong. All I see are patterns. The Sinspawn are relentless, but they are simple creatures. They're drawn to strong emotions, ones that echo their primitive urges. It's the same reason why they would attack taverns full of rowdy drunkards but leave the school alone. 
> 
> Perhaps if I appeal to His Majesty, he'll see the genius in my plan. Make their folly our advantage. If only I could track where one goes, I'd be able to pinpoint the reason they seem to be never-ending.

Two waves of light and physical energy. A week ago, and today.

Ceyan "Saiyan" will come to talk to [[Marcus]]. They will be here in a week.

Theres a book place too, the Neocroms.
