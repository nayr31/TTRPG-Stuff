- +5 HP
- Martial ranged weapons

Skills:
- When you perform a ranged attack, you may spend 10 Mind Points to choose one option: the attack gains multi (2); or you increase the attack's multi property by one, up to a maximum of multi (3).
- After a creature you can see performs a ranged attack, you may spend an amount of Mind Points equal to the total Result of their Accuracy Check in order to have the attack fail automatically against all targets. You can only use this Skill if you have a ranged weapon equipped, and it has no effect if the Accuracy Check was a critical success.
