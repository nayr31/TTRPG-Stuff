During the last combat, we fought in acid rain.
[[Merrow]] accused [[Masud Ba]] of that.
There were a few survivors of [[APEX Venture & Services Group|AV&SG]] within their cockpits, who surrender.

We investigate the anomaly, who seems to sound like a heartbeat.
He is [[Tushar Waiba]], a newbie?

**Mirror rock gorge** was taken by [[APEX Venture & Services Group|AV&SG]] from [[Draum Hunting Supply|DHS]]. 

Our main goal is to secure [[Tushar Waiba|Tushar Waiba's]] mech, and recover the hostages.

We uncover a kid, [[Kiddo]]. 
Strange scales portrude from them, weird voice.

[[Horseshoe]] takes a look at some emails from their [[Draum Hunting Supply|DHS]] account, before checking out other things on the tower in the base.
Uncovers a conversation with "[[Sanguine]]".
> There's a fuck up, they need [[Tu'er Shen]] back up on the mountain.

[[Hound]] gets through the cockpit.

[[Merrow]] is [[Kiddo]]'s friend. He seems to be VERY relieved that [[Kiddo]] is safe.
Its evident that [[Kiddo]] isn't the one talking.

The one talking was [[Tu'er Shen]], and ACME NHP housed within [[Kiddo]].

We manage to get most of [[Tushar Waiba]] out form his frame, with only a few wires dangling out.
The scanner picks out cybernetic implants, but also some black spots. [[Kiddo]] reads with even more before shorting the scanner.
