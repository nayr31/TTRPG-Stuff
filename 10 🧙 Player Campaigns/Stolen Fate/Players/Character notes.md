Class Stuff:

> [!info] Specialty Crafting - Alchemical Items
> Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item. Select one of the specialties; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to [Craft](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#craft_crb) items of that type. If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to +2. If it's unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a [morningstar](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#morningstar_crb) and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.

> [!check] Quick Alchemy
> You swiftly mix up a short-lived alchemical item to use at a moment's notice. You create a single alchemical consumable item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book without having to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical reagents or needing to attempt a Crafting check. This item has the [infused](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#infused) trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn.

> [!info] Infused Reagents
> 
> You infuse reagents with your own alchemical essence, allowing you to create alchemical items at no cost. Each day during your daily preparations, you gain a number of batches of infused reagents equal to your level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use these reagents for either advanced alchemy or [Quick Alchemy](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#quick%20alchemy_crb), described below. Together, these infused reagents have light Bulk.
> 
> As soon as you make your next daily preparations, your infused reagents from the previous day's preparations are instantly destroyed, and nonpermanent effects of your previous day's infused items immediately end. While infused reagents are physical objects, they can't be duplicated, preserved, or created in any way other than your daily preparations. Any such artificial reagents lack the infusion and are useless for advanced alchemy or [Quick Alchemy](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#quick%20alchemy_crb).

> [!info] Advanced Alchemy
During your daily preparations, after producing new infused reagents, you can spend batches of those infused reagents to create infused alchemical items. You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical reagent requirements. Your advanced alchemy level is equal to your level. For each batch of infused reagents you spend, choose an alchemical item of your advanced alchemy level or lower that's in your formula book, and make a batch of two of that item. These items have the [infused](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#infused) trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.

> [!info] Alchemical Crafting
> You can use the [Craft](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#craft_crb) activity to create alchemical items. When you select this feat, you immediately add the formulas for four [common 1st-level alchemical items](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:,flstlevel:min=0~max=1,flstrarity:common=1,flstitem:alchemical=1,flmtitem:sand,flstweapon:,flmtweapon:sand) to your formula book.
> 
> *Choose 4 common 1st*

> [!tip] Formula Book
> An alchemist keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard [formula book](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#formula%20book%20(blank)_crb) worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two [common 1st-level alchemical items](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#blankhash,flstitem:alchemical=1,flstlevel:min=1~max=1,flstrarity:common=1) of your choice, in addition to those you gained from [Alchemical Crafting](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#alchemical%20crafting_crb) and your research field.
> 
> Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them with the [Inventor](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#inventor_crb) feat.
> 
> *Choose 2 common 1st, then 2 more every level (up to that level)*
> 1. [Lady's Blessing Oil](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#lady's%20blessing%20oil_lotg)
> 2. 

> [!info] Bomber
> You specialize in explosions and other violent alchemical reactions. You start with the formulas for two [1st-level alchemical bombs](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#blankhash,flstcategory:bomb=1,flstlevel:min=1~max=1,flsttype:null=1) in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas.
> 
> When throwing an alchemical bomb with the [splash](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#splash) trait, you can deal [splash](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#splash) damage to only your primary target instead of the usual splash area.
> 
> *Choose 2 1st level alchemical bombs*

> [!danger] Powerful Alchemy
> Alchemical items you create on the fly are particularly potent. When you use [Quick Alchemy](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#quick%20alchemy_crb) to create an infused alchemical item that allows a saving throw, you can change its DC to your class DC.

> [!info] Perpetual Infusions
> You have learned how to create perpetual alchemical infusions that can provide a near-infinite supply of certain simple items. You gain the ability to create two 1st-level alchemical items using [Quick Alchemy](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#quick%20alchemy_crb) without spending a batch of infused reagents. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book. Each time you gain a level, you can swap any number of your perpetual infusions with other eligible infusions.
> **Bomber:** Choose two [1st-level bombs](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#blankhash,flstlevel:min=1~max=1,flsttype:,flstcategory:bomb=1).

> [!info] Double Brew
> You know your formulas so well that you can concoct two items at once. When using the [Quick Alchemy](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#quick%20alchemy_crb) action, instead of spending one batch of infused reagents to create a single item, you can spend up to two batches of infused reagents to make up to two alchemical items as described in that action. These items do not have to be the same.

> [!info] Perpetual Potency
> Your perpetual infusions improve, allowing you to use [Quick Alchemy](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#quick%20alchemy_crb) to create more powerful items with no cost. The items you can select depend on your research field and must be in your formula book.
> **Bomber:** Choose two [3rd-level or lower bombs](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#blankhash,flstlevel:min=1~max=3,flsttype:,flstcategory:bomb=1).
