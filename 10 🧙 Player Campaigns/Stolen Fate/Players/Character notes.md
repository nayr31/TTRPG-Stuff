> [!info] Specialty Crafting - Alchemical Items
> Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item. Select one of the specialties; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to [Craft](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#craft_crb) items of that type. If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to +2. If it's unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a [morningstar](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#morningstar_crb) and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.
