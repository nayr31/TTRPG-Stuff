> [!info] Specialty Crafting - Alchemical Items
> Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item. Select one of the specialties; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to [Craft](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#craft_crb) items of that type. If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to +2. If it's unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a [morningstar](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#morningstar_crb) and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.

> [!info] Alchemical Crafting
> You can use the [Craft](https://pf2etools.com/actions.html#craft_crb) activity to create alchemical items. When you select this feat, you immediately add the formulas for four [common 1st-level alchemical items](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#blankhash,flstsource:,flstlevel:min=0~max=1,flstrarity:common=1,flstitem:alchemical=1,flmtitem:sand,flstweapon:,flmtweapon:sand) to your formula book.

> *Choose 4 common 1st*

> [!tip] Formula Book
> An alchemist keeps meticulous records of the formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard [formula book](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#formula%20book%20(blank)_crb) worth 10 sp or less for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two [common 1st-level alchemical items](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#blankhash,flstitem:alchemical=1,flstlevel:min=1~max=1,flstrarity:common=1) of your choice, in addition to those you gained from [Alchemical Crafting](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#alchemical%20crafting_crb) and your research field.
> 
> Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to invent them with the [Inventor](https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#inventor_crb) feat.
> 
> *Choose 2 common 1st, then 2 more every level (up to that level)*

> [!info] Bomber
> You specialize in explosions and other violent alchemical reactions. You start with the formulas for two [1st-level alchemical bombs](https://pf2etools.com/items.html#blankhash,flstcategory:bomb=1,flstlevel:min=1~max=1,flsttype:null=1) in your formula book, in addition to your other formulas.
> 
> When throwing an alchemical bomb with the [splash](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#splash) trait, you can deal [splash](https://pf2etools.com/traits.html#splash) damage to only your primary target instead of the usual splash area.
