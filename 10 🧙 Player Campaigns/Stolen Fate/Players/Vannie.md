# Background

Born into a somewhat not-so well-off family, Vanessa "Vannie" Harmsworth has had to help out to earn the extra coin to put food on the table. Her parents, Ralph and Roxanne Harmsworth were both laborers, so it wasn't long until they developed health problems and passed. Luckily, Vannie had saved enough and gained enough from selling their estate (if you could even call it that) to open ChemCat Tattoos, a tattoo parlor and reagent shop. It was somewhat successful, especially because of her connections to her parent's old employers.

It was a success, and Vannie managed to hire an employee who appreciated the same art, Brute (and orc tattoo artist). Feeling satisfied with the stability of the shop, and the person she left it with, she heads for Golarion in search of new suppliers, tattoo designs, and fun to be had.
