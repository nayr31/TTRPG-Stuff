# Backstory

Akemi, along with her brother Roka, were elite agents of Midnight, an elite and secretive SSC squad. Everything was going smooth mission to mission. One mission however, to investigate a suspected metavault, went horribly wrong and resulted in the death of some of her squad mates, and her brother thrown into a crystalized blinkspace. During this incident, a HORUS entity reached out and saved Akemi and her surviving squadmates from doom from within the vault, at a price. Now, she follows the orders of ARCHEMEDIES. The first was to cut ties with SSC and escape the watchful eye of SSC (her squad helped with that, assuming her dead in reports). With a fresh of the press HORUS license and a new callsign `Spitfire`, Albatross is the next stop in her path in hopes to pay off her debts and get some answers about her brother.
