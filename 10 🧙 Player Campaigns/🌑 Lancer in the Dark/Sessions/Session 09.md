Summary: Edri. There is a looped distress signal coming from the base. We get there and explore a little, only to run into HA once again.

To Edri

Looped transmission
recorded
scientist
research facility
hostile takeover
HCOMM forces

orbital ship, unidentified markers

inside is powered off, subalterns dont need light
they are walking around
still have that red glow when we first got here

blow it up

base is a dome, with transport vehicles, doors for them
might have been side entrances, blizzard ruined them
