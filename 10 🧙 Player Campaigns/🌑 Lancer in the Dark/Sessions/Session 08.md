Summary: Left the planet, gained some intel on stigos minad, left for Edri.
---
Stigos minand (KTB minastic order) will be pissed if we kill it, but we captured it.

After each anomaly, we become either more anchored to this universe, or reject it.

Akemi is washed over by things, and an NHP starts to speak through 

--> Juliana
Stigos minad are weird for wanting paracausal
They reported weird reports about disturbances
Rumor: Looking to harness the residual paracasual energy within the anomalies to link it back to Apothis
(they want to utilize the energy to interact with apothis - no way given)

Planet in the *Edri system*, they lost signal with them. They might have more clues

Now knights under Ospery order of *the Jade Glaive*
