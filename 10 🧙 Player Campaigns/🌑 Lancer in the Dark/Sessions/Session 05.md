Summary: Ashe discovers some info about our new universe.
---
Flying away from the abandoned shipyard.

Good news and bad news.
Bad: Seem to be displaced dimensionally.

Seems to be 3 major political bodies in the known current galaxy:

Harrison Committee (H-COMM), the ones we just fought. Their unit in particular is acquisitions and management. "Committee liberator teams"
Legate Crossnar was the leader

Karakorian Agregorian Union
Agregorian genocide never happened

Last one is HORUS. Extra governmental body for NHP rights and supervision of governmental bodies.

Apothis entity might be connected to RA.

Albatross equivalent: Osprey
Officially categorized as a clerical chivalric order
"St.Jo-an" Harrison
Tried to kill JCH-III but perished
Knights worship them, beatified this person

Probably best to try and leave, follow one of Ashe's readings to return
