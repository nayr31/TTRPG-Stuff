Lights flicker and dim, minutes go by without power
ASH "I'm in a dark place"

Make our way, completely shut off
Stuck in the dark
Sparking sound, static, coming from the right

Door trying to close, something in the way
Large exposed powerline

Get through, now a small chamber with 4 different directions
Paths split, static noise continues, still no power
