Lights flicker and dim, minutes go by without power
ASH "I'm in a dark place"

Make our way, completely shut off
Stuck in the dark
Sparking sound, static, coming from the right

Door trying to close, something in the way
Large exposed powerline

Get through, now a small chamber with 4 different directions
Paths split, static noise continues, still no power
Door is powered open

--zzt--
subalterns guarding a "generator", best place to start it up
bust in guns blazing
"Another one for masters project"
[[Lotus]] hacks them, slowing them down
[[Princess]] heads on over to the generator
many more checks...
"Revenge for out fallen brothers"

Accepting Ra's bargain makes you hear or see a whisper of words, blinking into vision the parts of the mangled wreckage
Not with words, but with emotions

The generator starts back up, and pulses all the subalterns down in the room
"No, don't unlock"

Faded Union emblem, chassis' are torn in places
The symbol gives a migraine
Ring with large planet
