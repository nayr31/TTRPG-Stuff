We awaken in our mechs, powered down

Receive a signature (recorded message) from ASH
"Dark hanger"

We are in a hanger, warehouse, storage containers
Abandoned for many years
Spray painted label "Ayona Shipyard"

Electromagnetic pings on the other side of the room
Crates filled with subalterns, very advanced/sophisticated
Less mechanical, weird fusion of human and robotic components

One of the crates spring to life as [[Spitfire]] gets close
Garbled words
Chain reaction

"Become one, we must"
"Must help master"

Get through the gate, into a hallway
Monitors looking outside
Some of the area is recognizable, but now a much larger complex
Big shipyard, no longer worked on
Civilian freight

ASH mentioned they were locked away somewhere, lets get to that
Flickering lights, not a lot of power
