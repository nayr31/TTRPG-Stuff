Saber was born of an upcoming, semi-morally ambiguous genetics project (star-chaser) that started a few years from the present day in hopes to create a new generation of heroes. Although secret in nature, Saber was raised on a strict training regimen and sense of justice from the administrators and mentors of the program. Around his 16th birthday, he started to become integrated into the hero community. First as an new and unknown up and comer, and then revealed to be the pet project in the works for many years at the behest of the organizer (in hopes to make more artificial heroes, and gain fame). Project nebula was created to create more heroes, but it wasn't long until an extreme, emerging threat would take hold and force the hero community to attempt a time travel rescue plan. Saber was the best choice, as new teen heroes are easily found, and more easily integrated into new teams.

Key npcs:
- Margret - Lead organizer, funder, and spokesperson for project star-chaser. (bold, fine taste)
- Gianni - Lead geneticist. (moody, likes moss)
- Taylor. - Combat instructor (rough, sincere)
- Yula. - Morals instructor. (affectionate, stern)
- Unknown future superhero??

Notes:
- Personality: Mature, serious, calculated, but totally willing to "hang out"
- As the others learn more about his past (future?), it could raise ethical concerns about his origins and the origins of artificial heroes
- Being more exposed to a team environment will pose big problems for Saber. Experiencing new emotions, types of relationships, and values firsthand. Possibly shape his sense of morals depending.
- "Struggling with his identity" while trying to save the future is the (hopeful) narrative arc
