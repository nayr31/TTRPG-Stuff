Geoff (hereby Jeff), was born the youngest of 3 siblings: Rebecca, Joel, and Strawberry (his parents went through an odd, "hippie" phase, but Strawberry decided to keep it). Growing up within the Wake household was a rabid mixture of beauty pageants, gardening, and being an unlicensed tax firm that hired children. Always upbeat, his father, Jeffy, would make sure every day was an adventure, a blast, and more importantly, radical. Jeff was like a beacon of reflection, taking most of his energy from his dad - they were best friends. His mom, Amanda, was a super serious business woman with a soft spot for goofballs. Although very serious, money is always tight, and that's why they decided to open "JAM's Taxes and Taxidermy". His siblings were more reserved and realistic, and eventually convinced him to get a real job outside of the house, against his own wishes.

Family matters to Jeff, so it was a big hit to him when his father died in that wildfire at the waterpark. The Wake (pun intended) was sorrowful to all who attended, but Jeff rose from the ashes and become the Jeffy he was always meant to be. He remains on good terms with his siblings, but not so much his mother. When it comes to friends, its mostly work colleagues. He hosts parties (lots of karaoke and axe throwing). His most trusted colleague is he co-barista, Suzie Chapstick. They get along well, and often share dog pictures and theoretical stories about random workers (relationships, murderers, and potential axe throwing partners).

Following the agency's "natural elevation protocol", Jeff was selected as the perfect unit to take care of Anomaly SD-004, nicknamed "Waterdog" by the scientists (Jeff calls him Rover sometimes, Roger others).
