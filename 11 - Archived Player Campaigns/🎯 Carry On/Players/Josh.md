> Small towns breed large mysteries, and even bigger imaginations.

Josh, son to Karen and Jacob Richard, lived in a remote fishing town on the easternmost part of Newfoundland. From a young age he had little interest in the "playdates" that his mom would set him on, always sensing there was more than meats the eye in the strange forests that surrounded the town. Getting older, he started sneaking out and exploring the forests, always finding strange tracks not recorded in any of the many nature books his dad would gift every year on Christmas. Things definitely didn't go as planned, and he eventually got got by something, managing to barely escape with a wound across his eyes and forehead. The other kids and parents all assumed that his little escapades into the woods meant that he just took a bad fall across a shrubbleberry bush, but he knew.

His research spread online of various myths and mysteries from different cultures, these had to have some relevancy, right? Unfortunately his folks wanted him to get a job by the end of the school years, but he had no time for any of that. This drab old town had little to it, and there was more out there.

Backpacking through the Canadian highways was dangerous at best, but going from town to town talking to locals bred new heights of inspiration and discovery for his leads, but leads and random google searches make you end up on lists, and NAHA was looking for someone with some intuition and inginuity.

- His goals:
	- Uncover more mysteries, and bring them to light (its cool shit too ya know). It seems like this NAHA might have some secrets of its own...
	- Write a book maybe? Just to show those hicks back home that he was right
