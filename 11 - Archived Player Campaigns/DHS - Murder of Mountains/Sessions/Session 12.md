Summary: I go back, talk to Pandora's dad, and light some bonfires.

Broadwater is taken back to the retreat with the other mechs

The others visit "Shangri-la", but its not as it seems.
Rock and stone break, trees all around be scary ðŸ‘».

Orville in a tree, Kabuki mask scorpion?

Cassian knows and is special, will help.
Esther says something is still in the Jersey frame, the frame itself stands up
Attacks, lashes out, and we chase after it to the shaded valley.

The nhp reaches out to the shadow realm, gets the mech to our little business in the Shaded Valley
We need to use fired wooded pedestals to talk to the other side

24 Hours is what it will take, or, what Esther is giving me...
The pyres are lit, they need to **stay** lit
Fog encroaches, thin the bars, slip through
