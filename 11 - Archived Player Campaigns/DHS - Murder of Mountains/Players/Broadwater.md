Cesic (se-zick) was a station-born habitant that lived there their entire life. Their parents (quite well off pharmaceutical board members) enjoyed the quite life up in orbit, but it was nonetheless lonely without many visitors. Early on his parents would dote and doddle on him as they were excited about the prospects that he could bring, but now that he thinks about it he was most likely born for no other reason but their amusement.

Cesic is 24 now, his parents station destroyed in a asset seizure went wrong, his childhood memories of playing doctor and watching his mom do virtual duck hunt could only last so long when undergoing black market mech training. That didn't last long either. His time after being sold off was cut short due to the other problem: why train a medic to fight? It was obvious that he had some field experience, either from his father enjoying his time out in the field, or from "the simulations" that his parents were most known for (that he tested).

The company Cesic was forced to work for sold him off, and he eventually made his way to DHS through the proper channels. 
Was this where he wanted to be? Would he stay if they treated him right? Maybe being a mech pilot could be interesting, its just a site ranger position anyway, how hard could it be? Just like the camping situations of old Earth.

Notes: Themes of abandonment, would avoid combat/confrontation if possible or take a non-lethal approach.

**Where did they grow up and what was home like?**
They grew up isolated in space with their parents aboard their private pharmaceutical research station, but it didn't last as it was lost in an asset seizure gone wrong. Home was testing, probes, experimental drugs and combat simulations.

**What was their history before joining DHS and how has it changed?**
Their early years after their parent's downfall were laced with quick and dirty jobs, rapid mercenary deployment when their employer was lacking on filling out a roster, and long hauls on dusty frigates. Reputation, manna, and skills have placed Cesic in a higher degree of class over other field medics and can choose the jobs offered, no longer forced by the need for resources.

**Do they like working for DHS? If yes, how loyal to the company are they? If no, why do they stay?**
Although DHS has its flaws, its a very nice change of pace from the regular jobs they've been working the last 10 years. This may be their new position as a Site Ranger, but they have already been with the company for a year at most. That won't make them totally loyal per say, but it will give Cesic some bias towards the company.

**How did they become a Site Ranger and why were they selected for this position?**
Having vast medical knowledge and medical field experience can get you placed almost anywhere on any rim. Being a previous employee (although in another sector) helped.

During [[11 - Archived Player Campaigns/DHS - Murder of Mountains/Sessions/Session 04|Session 04]], the party passes out from the haze made from the burning trees. Here is what Cesic dreams about.

Cesic falls asleep at the controls of Snapshot's mech, drifting away into a slumber longer than any other. While they sleep, they dream of lilac gardens and blood stained fields. Bodies are pulled through the flowers into the ground, never to be seen again. Cesic cries as they fail to stop the bodies from being pulled in one after another. Someone pulls them away, and the field slowly drifts into the distance as they are placed inside of a metal casket.
