Got the GPS back up and running.

Secured the previous location of [[Tu'er Shen]]'s casket.

Seems like [[APEX Venture & Services Group|AV&SG]] was investigating the problem too:
> Return the blood of the child, casket...

We meet Sanguine on a frozen lake, where [[Bream]] is placed into his father's old mech.

An extract later, [[Masud Ba]] takes his leave off planet with some [[Draum Hunting Supply|DHS]] licenses. [[Bream]] and [[Tu'er Shen]] start to share presence, and [[Omni Memetic Deterrence Initiative|OMDI]] enact a reverse restraining order on them.
