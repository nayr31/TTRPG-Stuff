Summary: Arrived at [[DRM-II]], met [[Appalachia]], and tracked [[Merrow]] into the plains/
---
After arriving at the lodge, we were accepted by [[Appalachia]], and as a token of goodwill for defending the ship from the pirates upgraded our rooms at the lodge.

We asked around for info on [[Merrow]], including a bar, and a hospital.
[[Sky Devil]] managed to get a lead, "ask the mechanic".
After an almost murder and a successful blackmail, we use a land crawler to track [[Merrow]] into the plains.
