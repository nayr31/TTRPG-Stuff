1. What time period? -> Post 2019
	1. Pre 1980, the park is a tourist trap and sharks are lurking, looking for profit in its deep depths
	2. 1980 the park is officially formed, owned and operated by the US government, letting the original org Anodyne keep the mining rights. 1987 the pit is classified as the PBSO
	3. Post 2007, the park is closed off to the public following the July 4th disaster (pg.7 - Flash floods caused the pit to "swallow", taking the visitor center and all the people inside of it deeper. It then "awoke", lashing its limbs out from the desert. Rumors say that there are survivors from the swallow still living down there.)
2. Conformity (pg.109), or shock (pg.111)?
3. 

Character creation:
Foci (pg.18, 47)
Satire, Subcontractors
Prototypes, Special issue tbd
People of the pit, not too cosmic
Working for Anodyne
Shock, not conformity
