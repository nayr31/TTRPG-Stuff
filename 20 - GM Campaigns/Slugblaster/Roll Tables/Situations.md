| [[Jet Collective]]’s strong passion and principles have started to curl back in on itself, turning what would be normal drama between friends into an all-out war of accusations, ultimatums, and brinkmanship. If someone doesn’t step in, [[Jet Collective]] could implode entirely, causing shock waves through the scene. |
| [[Hardecker]] had no idea what they were signing up for when they sponsored [[The Wicks]], and their board is only now realizing what they’ve got—the hottest property in the slugblasting market, and an absolute PR nightmare. [[The Wicks]] could make life-changing money, but only if they start playing by the rules.   |
| [[The Arborists]] believe there is a disease of sorts spreading through the limbs of the multiverse, threating to rot the entire tree. If they can’t figure out what’s going on, they’ll be forced to start pruning entire branches.                                                                                          |
| Sensing a sea change with the rise of popular streamers like [[Lazy Bunny]], [[The Old Guard]] is planning a battery of hot takes and think pieces that will tear the scene in two. All must pick a side.                                                                                                                     |
| [[Shimmer]] thrives in this era of nebulous trade laws and spotty border control. But improved infrastructure and oversight threaten this wild west, and slugblasters are fast becoming the only ones who can still slip through the cracks.                                                                                  |
| [[Doorways]] is facing a crossroads. Sensing defeat, some members are trying to backtrack and turn [[Doorways]] into a pro-slugblasting safety awareness group, while other members have only become more zealously opposed to all of it, like the growing subsect of multiverse deniers in the “One Universe Society.”       |
| [[Miper]] has a vision for a more connected multiverse. As part of that vision, [[Miper]] has decided to build a hugely expensive interdimensional train, which requires them to switch to an entirely new Q-Form, rendering all current Nth gear products incompatible with local spacetime.                                 |
| [[Hardecker]] is holding their first ever slugblasting tournament, and they clearly have no idea what they’re doing, because the top prize is a ludicrous amount of money. However, it’s being protested by a group of [[The Mavens\|Mavens]], and Slugblaster Magazine is covering the protest.                              |
| [[Mr. Wikie\|Wilkie]], the company’s elderly, thrill-seeking founder has been missing for nearly a year. The company has done everything it can to cover it up, but rumors are getting out and conspiracy theories are forming.                                                                                               |
| [[FUST]] is freaking out about the pending deal between [[Scram Cat]] and [[Miper]]. [[Scram Cat]] may be their bitter rival, but it’s also an OG legend! It shouldn’t be bought by some big tech company! It should be bought by [[FUST]], as a hilarious flex.                                                              |
| The scene has been arranged like this for years. But things are changing. Power is shifting, lines are blurring, [[The Thrashers]] like pop music now, and there are whispers of entirely new crowds bubbling out from the cultural ether.                                                                                    |
