Negafriction is just what it sounds like: complete nonsense. Normally, friction converts kinetic energy into heat, causing objects to slow down and get warmer. But negafriction swords speed up and get cooler. Just like you!

## Function

Roll to slice, dice, chop, and stab things (or non-lethally smack them with the kinetically charged sheath).

## Mods

- **Slip Rattle (1 Coil, 1 Disc).** Roll to teleport inuniverse by slicing spacetime. If you can’t see your destination, potential problems are worse.
- **Field Projector (1 Lens, 1 Coil).** Roll to temporarily remove the surface friction from a room-sized area near you.
- **Ref Coating (1 Lens, 1 Gem).** Avoid slams from lasers and other electromagnetic energy by marking 1 turbo, redirecting the attack wherever you wish.
- **Negafriction Wake (1 Disc, 1 Gem).** Roll to boost your speed as your sword accelerates through matter (even air) and pulls you along.
- **Subdimensional Edge (2 gems, 1 lens, 1 coil).** You can roll to temporarily slice entire dimensions off of a target, turning a 3D object 2D, for example, or removing someone from the timestream. The target re-coheres after a minute or two. It’s not pleasant, but mostly harmless.
