Skip boring. Skip average. Skip to the good part with Skipmode runners. The commercial shows a kid fast-forwarding through his homework, but everyone knew it was just clever marketing for a fairly average modular shoe. Until sluggers got ahold of them...

## Function

Use your powered midsoles to run, jump, and slide super fast, easily keeping up with your pals on hoverboards.

## Mods

- **Anti-Negafriction Outsoles (1 Gem, 1 Disc).** You can run up walls, hang from ceilings, etc. Complex or risky maneuvers may require a roll, as usual.
- **Energy Tenser (1 Coil, 1 Disc).** With a running start, roll to teleport in-universe. If you can’t see your destination, potential problems are worse.
- **Temporal Scrubber (1 Lens, 1 Gem).** Reveal you’ve been fast-forwarding through most of this snooze fest. Refill 1 hype. Mark 1 trouble and try not to think about all you’ve missed by not being present. Being constantly stoked is not the same as living.
- **Chrono Clip (1 Disc, 1 Gem).** Mark 1 turbo to avoid a physical slam by skipping a few seconds into the future. Others think you disappeared briefly.
- **Causality Hoop (2 Gems, 1 Lens, 1 Coil).** Mark 2 turbo to rewind time a few seconds and retry an action, warn someone of a slam, change tactics, etc. (Due to, uh, temporal rippling, game resources like boost, trouble, etc. still stay as they are, however.)
