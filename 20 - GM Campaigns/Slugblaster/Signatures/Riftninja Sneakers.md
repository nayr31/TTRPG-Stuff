Riftninja sneakers are branded as performance-wear for pro-level capture-the-flag athletes, hoping to distance themselves from their core market of graffiti artists, vandals, thieves, and kids trying to sneak out  
the house.

## Function

Use astral phasing to become slightly not here, ghostly and ethereal, which can help you sneak around.

## Mods

- **Hyperphaser (1 Lens, 1 Gem).** You can roll to phase through walls and other matter.
- **Anti-Negafriction Outsoles (1 Gem, 1 Disc).** You can run up walls, hang from ceilings, etc. Complex or risky maneuvers may require a roll, as usual.
- **Powered Midsoles (1 Coil, 1 Gem).** Run, jump, and slide super fast, easily keeping up with hoverboards.
- **Reaction Switch (1 Coil, 1 Disc).** Mark 1 turbo to avoid a physical slam by turning ghostly just before it hits.
- **Plane Haunt (2 Lenses, 2 Gems).** Spend 1 turbo to create a extra version of yourself. You share resources and can roll to swap minds. Ends after a few hours or whenever one of you takes a slam and disintegrates horribly (that slam lingers with the remaining “you” as concept shock). Also, mark 1 turbo to clear 2 trouble. There was a you covering at home this whole time.
