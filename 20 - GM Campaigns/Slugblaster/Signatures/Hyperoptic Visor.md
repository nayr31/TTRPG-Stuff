## Mods

- **Realmware Lens (1 Lens, 1 Disc).** Roll to see energy fields, invisible entities, and in-depth biometrics. Also acts as a spacetime ampimeter (page 64).
- **Omniscience Aperture (1 Lens, 1 Coil).** You can see through walls, into objects, and all around you. Also, mark 1 turbo to avoid dodgeable slams.
- **Spacetime Periscope (1 Lens, 1 Coil).** Roll to press up against the spacetime membrane and spy on a neighbouring universe.
- **Powered Crunk Filter (1 Disc, 1 Gem).** Mark +1 style when you successfully use a trick to take a dope picture or video.
- **Adv. Neural Imaging (2 Lenses, 1 Coil, 1 Disc).** You can roll to see and record a subject’s active surface thoughts. It’s obvious you’re doing it, but adding kick allows you to do it secretly and/or zoom into deeper thoughts and memories. Use caution.
