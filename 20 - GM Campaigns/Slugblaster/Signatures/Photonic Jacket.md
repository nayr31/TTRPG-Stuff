## Mods

- **Flash Patterns (1 Lens, 1 Disc).** Roll to blind, daze, confuse, entrance, or cause seizures in targets that can see your jacket.
- **Ambiance Panel (1 Gem, 1 Coil).** Freely program non-realistic, translucent graphics within ten feet of you, or roll to create a more convincing illusion. Preparation and/or image data may be required.
- **Photo Bypass (1 Coil, 1 Lens).** Roll to fold normal light around you and blend in with your surroundings. Remember to put your hood up!
- **Hardlight Upscaling (1 Lens, 1 Disc).** Roll to temporarily augment your jacket with useful hardlight ornaments such as glowing tentacles, giant polygonal fists or briefly serviceable wings.
- **Concept Prism (2 Lenses, 1 Gem, 1 Disc).** Mark 1 turbo. You temporarily split into 3d6 colourful instances of yourself. They are difficult to control, but tend to act like you would and stay nearby.
