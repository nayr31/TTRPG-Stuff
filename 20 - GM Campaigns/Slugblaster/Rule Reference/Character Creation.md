## 1 - Pick Your Personality

Your personality defines your strengths, attitude, and approach. There are five to choose from: The Grit, The Guts, The Smarts, The Heart, and The Chill, detailed on the following pages. Your personality isn’t about what you can do, it’s about how. All slugblasters can shred, shoot, party, and rework a fusion array. The Smarts will just do it differently than The Guts would.
- **Your Look.** Look details describe how you dress and present yourself physically. Pick as many as you like.
- **Your Family.** Who you live with, the ones concerned about when you get home at night. Pick two details that describe them.
- **Your Bond.** Pick one bond you have with another character.
- **Your Vibe.** Mannerisms and quirks specific to your personality, listed on the following pages. Pick as many as you like.
- **Your Traits.** Traits are special powers based on your personality, listed on the following pages. Pick one to start with. You unlock more with trait beats. One of your traits can be from another personality. See Personal Growth on page 160 for an example.
- **Your Gear.** You start with your phone, raygun, hoverboard, and one special personality item. Choose two more pieces of gear to start with from page 64.

### The Grit
^30128e

You have focus, patience, and resilience. You’ve spent hours practicing the same hoverboard trick over and over until it’s perfect, and your gear is organized, well-maintained, and as durable as you are. You don’t expect things to be easy. Sometimes the only way is the hard way, and when everyone else has gone home, you’re just getting started.

Play as The Grit if you want to take lots of slams, have lots of boost, be the dependable one in the crew, and solve problems with precision, hard work, and dedication.

Rocky Balboa (Rocky), Leslie Knope (Parks and Recreation), John McClane (Die Hard), Judy Hopps (Zootopia), Dave (Kick- Ass), Eleven (Stranger Things), Mei Ling (Turning Red), and Stevie (Mid90s) all have a lot of grit.

### The Guts
^a3d046

You’ve got confidence, boldness, sass, and chutzpah. You bet on yourself, challenge convention, throw caution to the wind, and go for broke. Your hoverboard tricks are fast, big, and unnecessarily dangerous. Your hacks are suped-up, overclocked, and absolutely a fire hazard. Hey, if you’re too scared of doing something wrong, you’ll never do anything great, right?

Play as The Guts if you want to take lots of big risks, do lots of tricks, play the loose cannon, and solve problems by making big moves and generally being God’s gift to slugblasting.

### The Smarts
^28c031

It’s not about intelligence. It’s about curiosity, love-of-learning, a fascination with the world and how it works, and a willingness to think about things from different angles. Your hoverboard tricks are creative and outside-the-box, your hacks are experimental and complex, and everything around you is a problem to be solved.

Play as The Smarts if you want to explore and contribute to the setting, ask lots of questions, give lots of answers, mess around with a bunch of device mods, and solve problems in clever, creative ways.

Hiro (Big Hero 6), Gadget (Rescue Rangers), Princess Bubblegum (Adventure Time), Violet (A Series of Unfortunate Events), Nell (The Diamond Age), Donatello (TMNT) and skateboarding legend Rodney Mullen all have a lot of smarts.

### The Heart
^901a9a

Slugblasting is your life. You have integrity, intuition, passion, and empathy, and you rep your crew harder than anyone. Your gear is well-loved and highly personalized, and when you hoverboard people can tell you’re giving it all you got and loving every single moment.

Play as The Heart if you want to get in on the drama, lead by example, help others, and solve problems by working together and wanting it badly enough.

Finn (Adventure Time), Starfire (Teen Titans), Captain America (The Avengers), Ma-Ti (Captain Planet), Honey Lemon (Big Hero 6), Will (Stranger Things) Xander (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Steven (Steven Universe) all have a lot of heart.

### The Chill
^0061f8

Chill is effortlessness, zen, and going with the flow. You do stuff by feel, press buttons to see what happens, and somehow make even the simplest hoverboard tricks look steezey. Maybe you’re lucky, maybe you just notice what everyone else is too busy to.

Play as The Chill if you want to crack jokes, eat some snacks, let problems solve themselves, and not think too much.

The Dude (The Big Lebowski), MJ (Spider-Man: Homecoming), Indiana Jones, Priya (Turning Red), Todd (BoJack Horseman), Shaggy (Scooby-Doo), Deadpool, Wichita (Zombieland), Ilana (Broad City), and Fred (Big Hero 6) all have a lot of chill.

>
