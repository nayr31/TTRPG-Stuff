| 1   | **Hot Spot.** A random world pays out +5 crew<br>style this run. Can you even get there? There<br>just has to be a way, right?<br>*or*<br>**Irony, Maybe?** Against all odds, [[Hillview]] has briefly<br>become a hot spot, with teenage pilgrims from all over<br>gasping in mild interest.                                                                                     |
| 2   | **Solo Offer.** A faction wants to partner with one<br>of you. Reject it and displease them. Accept for<br>legacy or 3 components, but also 1 fracture.<br>*or*<br>**Tide Pods.** An online trend beckons all youth. Earn a<br>mega run bonus, but only if you post before the trend<br>sours and you lose style instead. Start a danger track.                                   |
| 3   | **Contest.** A video jam, live tournament, hack-athon,<br>or other exclusive contest. +1 bite, but a<br>chance at a mega prize.<br>*or*<br>**Name-Dropped.** Someone important talks about you.<br>+5 crew style. It doesn’t mean they like you, but it<br>does mean they know you exist.                                                                                         |
| 4   | **Collab.** You get invited by another crew on a<br>sick run with a mega prize, plus a chance to<br>impress their fans and associates.<br>*or*<br>**Team-Up.** A mutually beneficial opportunity arises for<br>you and a rival or enemy. Is this the beginning of an<br>uneasy truce? Or a mutually-toxic frenemyship?                                                            |
| 5   | **Rager.** You are invited to a festival, secret club,<br>or some other exclusive party with extra features<br>and prizes.<br>*or*<br>**Who You Know.** Someone offers to introduce you to<br>an important friend. Get mega favour with a faction,<br>but only if you don’t mess it up.                                                                                           |
| 6   | **Live and Direct.** A special run with a high<br>viewership, a packed crowd, or a hapless crew<br>of eager documentarians. +3 bite, but all tricks<br>earn +1 style.<br>*or*<br>**Viral.** Gain 1d6 crew style, then, if you want, keep<br>rolling. If you ever roll a 6, you bust and cause a<br>backlash, displeasing three factions and gaining only<br>5 crew style instead. |
| 7   | **Dream Run.** A chance to be first at a new spot,<br>sneak in somewhere legendary, or go on some<br>other run with a mega prize.<br>*or*<br>**Swag.** A sponsor gifts you with samples, testers, and<br>other freebies. +3 components each.                                                                                                                                      |
| 8   | **One Shot.** A pivotal run with a huge mega prize<br>that changes everything, but also +5 bite. <br>*or*<br>**VIP Access.** A faction shows you a secret two-way<br>gate between any two [[Worlds]]. What’s the catch?                                                                                                                                                               |
| 9+  | **Big in Japan.** You’ve become surprisingly popular<br>(+3) with an unexpected crowd. Why? <br>*or*<br>**Planar Eclipse.** A once in a lifetime dimensional<br>phenomenon gives you brief access to somewhere<br>normally inaccessible.                                                                                                                                          |

How does this<br>change your relationship with them?<br>*or*<br>**Planar Tectonics.** Two [[Worlds]] switch places on the<br>map. Do we know why? Is this an omen? How does<br>this seismic event change the political landscape?                                                                                           |
| 2   | **Bias of the Week.** One of you has emerged as<br>the fan favourite. Be humble for 1 style, or bask<br>in your spotlight for 5 style and a fracture.<br>*or*<br>**Hush-Hush.** An enemy of another faction makes you<br>a tantalizing offer. Taking it would be a betrayal, but<br>only if they find out.                                                                                                         |

How<br>can you set the record straight?<br>*or*<br>**Cooperation.** A faction asks a difficult, risky, or socially<br>awkward favour. Accept or displease them. ::grimace<br>emoji::                                                                                                                                     |
| 4   | **Threats.** A faction jumps you, brings you in for<br>questioning, etc. You each take a slam (shook,<br>tired, etc.) which can be noped individually.<br>*or*<br>**In the Middle.** Some of your fans cause trouble, two<br>allies start fighting, your sponsor makes a terrible PR<br>move, etc. Do you get involved?                                                                                            |

Accept or displease two crowds.<br>Being boring is even worse than being cowards.<br>*or*<br>**Rumours.** Someone is trying to turn you against each<br>other. Each player invents a thing they’ve heard about<br>a teammate. Take a fracture until you can sort it all out.                                                                |
| 6   | **Impostors.** Alternate yous show up, trying to<br>sleep in your beds and eat your sugarpops.<br>They think you’re the impostors. Are you? How<br>would you know for sure?<br>*or*<br>**Climate Change.** One of your crew’s brands is falling<br>out of fashion, offering no style bonus for the next 1–3<br>[[Runs]] (determined secretly by the GM). Rebrand, hold<br>out, or try to fight the shifting tides. |
| 7   | **Snitches.** An authority talks with your families<br>about your behaviour, auto-triggering everyone’s<br>next Family beat (but not Redemption).<br>*or*<br>**Invasion.** Something followed you home. Do nothing<br>and displease [[DARA\|Rescue]] or [[Doorways]], or try to fix it and<br>risk incriminating yourself even more.                                                                               |
