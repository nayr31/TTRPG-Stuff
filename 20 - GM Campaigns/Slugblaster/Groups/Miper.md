---
Some people are different. They choose excellence. They choose precision. They choose something with classical music and confusing shots of austere architecture and European models in their advertisements. They choose [[Miper]], a design-focused tech company striving to change the world one innovation at a time.

**Assets:**
A partially operational interdimensional train, an expensive R&D campus in [[Popularia]], one endowment away from voting majority on [[Popularia]] University’s board, a library of patents and a piranha tank of lawyers, market dominance in telecom and social media, the prestigious Young Genius scholarship, and [[Scram Cat]] (pending evaluation).

**Likes:**
Scientific discovery, innovation, and crews with passion and something to say, as long as it’s not something critical of [[Miper]].

**Dislikes:**
Irreverence, crews who don’t take this seriously, [[DARA|Rescue]], [[Doorways]], [[The Arborists]], and [[FUST]].
