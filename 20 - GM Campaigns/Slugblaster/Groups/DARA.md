Summary: Privately operated, government funded particle physics lab in [[Hillview]]. Crooked space-time cops.
---
DARA (Dimensional Access and Research Agency) is a privately-operated, government-funded particle physics lab operating in Hillview. At best they provide scholarships and mentorship to young people, while their Rescue unit provides help to people in serious trouble. At worst they are a shady for-profit experimentation facility with an army of crooked spacetime cops.

**Assets:**
A multibillion-dollar facility, impressive security, highly-trained ultranauts, two long-shuttered satellite
facilities, an underfunded Research & Innovation wing, a floundering Youth Science program, an over-funded
Rescue division, a newly-built Treatment centre, a freshly-minted Prevention division, squads of agents in powered EDA suits, fleets of drones, experimental zone locks, two twenty-client-capacity SAR harvesters, and a storage room full of confiscated slugblasting gear.

**Likes:**
New data, exciting discoveries, fostering young scientists, and monitoring/controlling Null’s spacetime.

**Dislikes:**
[[The Arborists]], being undermined, and punk kids bringing negative attention to extraplanar research.
