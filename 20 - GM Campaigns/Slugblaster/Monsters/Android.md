Androids can be found all over. From bouncers working dance clubs in Operaeblum, to interdimensional courier bots putting entrepreneurial slugblasters out of work, to rogue synthroids wandering the lower planes in hunting packs, to the malware-prone home assistants being developed by Miper. And while most androids are friendly collaborators, this one in front of you probably isnâ€™t.
