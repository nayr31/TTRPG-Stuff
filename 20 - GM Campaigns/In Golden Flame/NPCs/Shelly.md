Shelly is Jerry’s former co-pilot, the ASURA-class NHP that came with his Sherman, the Severance Pay. Since it’s currently stuck in a wall acting as an auxiliary power source for the printer, Shelly took on a new role as Jerry’s assistant, aiding him in the monumental task of keeping the station afloat.

Shelly has an efficient, pragmatic perspective, shot through with an arrogant streak, and maintains a polite but chilly detachment from all but a few residents of Hell’s Gate. She gets very passive-aggressive towards anyone she feels is causing stress in Jerry’s life, which will almost certainly include the player characters.

She does not usually provide a visual representation of herself. On the occasions that she does, she favors the image of a smart young woman with multiple sets of arms and a pair of glasses, which she pushes up her nose whenever she wants to be condescending.

Shelly has an odd personal fixation: a burning desire to *“actually eat food at least once, you know? It looks like a fascinating experience.”* If not otherwise pre-empted, Shelly has a tendency to assign food-based names to missions, ships and fireteams.
